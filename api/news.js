        "title": "Why Do Cats Hiss?",
        "text": "Feeling disturbed by the kitty you've had for years who keeps hissing at you and others? Pet owners need not be alarmed, cat hissing isn't necessarily cause for concern and is actually normal cat behavior. A cat hiss is a drawn-out, low intensity sound produced by a long exhalation from the feline, with their mouth open and teeth exposed. It is a very short sound and can stop suddenly. Hissing is accompanied by a change in body posture. You'll see the cat with their ears flattened to the side of the head, an arched back and their fur standing on end. But why do cats hiss at us and other animals? Newsweek asked the experts. Why Do Cats Hiss? A cat's hissing sound is involuntary and triggered by \"the surprise appearance of an enemy,\" a January 2020 study on feline behavior explained. \"The sound is produced mostly in agonistic situations in order to warn an opponent.\" Author Pam Johnson-Bennett from Cat Behavior Associates told Newsweek, the defensive sound indicates the cat is scared and feels threatened. \"Cats try to avoid physical confrontations so they use vocal warnings, in combination with body posturing to deter the opponent.\" Is Hissing a Sign of Aggression? It's important to note that hissing is not aggressive behavior but rather a sign that the cat is unhappy with something, Graham J. Lewis, a veterinary surgeon from the Paragon Veterinary Group, told Newsweek. \"It is usually a warning before any aggression and if you are able to understand this then the situation can be deescalated before the cat becomes aggressive,\" he explained. As it is a defensive form of communication, the hissing sound shows the cat does not want to engage and is hoping the threat will back off, Johnson-Bennett added. While hissing is not an indication of aggression, it can be a sign your cat will attack if they continue to be provoked. Why Is My Cat Hissing at Me? Hissing is an important mode of communication for your feline friends and indicates the cat is unhappy with a situation, Zazie Todd, the author of the forthcoming book PURR: The Science of Making Your Cat Happy, told Newsweek. Feeling threatened If your cat hisses at you or other humans, they may feel threatened by you or others at that moment or because of the way they are being handled. Lewis explained: \"This is usually because they are feeling threatened in some way. This might be something you are doing that is irritating your cat or they are wanting some space and to be left alone at that time.\" For example, a cat may hiss while you're trying to get them into a carrier for a visit to the veterinarian's office. The kitty may also hiss while being restrained by staff during examinations or treatments while there. Cats may even hiss at familiar animals or people if the immediate circumstances make them feel threatened, Johnson-Bennett noted. Fearing the Unfamiliar Some cats hiss due to a fear of new and unfamiliar people and objects in their home environment, which throws them off. Rachael Myers, Animal Behaviourist at U.K. pet charity Blue Cross told Newsweek: \"If you are doing something to your cat and they hiss at you it's important to listen to this and stop what you are doing.\" To help ease their fear, owners can try \"systematic desensitization with counter-conditioning,\" Dr. Marci Koski, a certified feline behavior and training professional with Feline Behavior Solutions in Vancouver, Washington, explained to PetMD. This entails gradually exposing your feline friend to low levels of whatever it fears (be that a person or an object), while providing positive reinforcements, such as treats or affection. \"With time, the hissing will decrease, and your cat will feel more comfortable with his home and its inhabitants,\" Koski said. Stress Cats do not cope well with stress, so the hissing could potentially be connected to stressors in their environment. They can sometimes be stressed out by loud noises and \"quick, sporadic movements,\" Alana Stevenson, a certified animal behaviorist based in Boston, explained in the PetMD article. It is not uncommon for cats to react defensively to stress by hissing. Physical Pain While it is less common than other reasons, your cat could be hissing because of pain, Lewis said. This can be especially the case if they're being touched at the location of their pain. For example, cats with arthritis may hiss when jumping off a chair or moving in a way that worsens their pain. Cats Hissing at Kittens Just like humans, cats can be very protective of their little ones, so don't be surprised if your cat hisses around her newly born kittens. \"Mother cats will hiss if someone comes too close to their kittens,\" Koski said. Myers highlighted cat's less than social nature: \"[They] often do not want to be in close contact with other cats, they may hiss at the cat or kitten to communicate this and to avoid conflict.\" Why Is My Cat Hissing at Other Cats? Cats may also hiss \"for territorial reasons and can be the start of cats fighting with one another,\" Lewis said. Cats hissing at each other in the house may indicate they aren't getting along very well, according to Todd. \"Cats shouldn't have to compete with each other for resources, so in a multi-cat home, always make sure each cat has access to their resources,\" the author said. Todd advises keeping one litter box per cat plus one spare. Each cat should have their own food and water dishes and they shouldn't have to eat next to each other. \"This can help to reduce the tension.\" Why Is My Cat Hissing at a Dog? A cat hissing at a dog is likely feeling threatened, according to Lewis. \"Often with time, cats can become good friends with dogs and will tolerate them well. However, a very boisterous dog will scare a cat initially.\" he explained. Myers agreed: \"If your cat is hissing at your dog your cat is likely to be communicating that they want space from your dog or feels threatened by your dog's presence. It is so important for cats to feel safe, so you would need to take steps to manage your dog from frightening your cat.\" In these cases, controlled introductions—where the cat has escape options and safe places (possibly up high) they can access—can help the pets accept one another better. Assuming the dog is safe and the cat is not at any risk, it's important to make sure the cat has places they can go that the dog can't access, according to Todd. For first meetings Myers recommends a few things to make your cat feel more secure. \"Set up a Feliway plug in before you bring your new pet home. Before introducing face to face you can exchange bedding between the pets, and \"scent swap\" by stroking your new pet's head with a soft cloth, before dabbing this around the home and furniture to mix with you existing pet's scent.\" \"When you feel you are ready to introduce them, exercise your dog first, and have them on a lead with some tasty treats – it's really important your dog doesn't have an opportunity to chase your cat as this could damage the chances of any positive relationship developing.\" Find more tips on introducing cats and dogs here. What Should I Do When My Cat Hisses? Pet owners should try to understand whether is something you're doing that might be irritating your cat. \"Give them space and ensure they have somewhere they feel safe,\" Lewis said. Those who may be worried that their cat is in pain should look for other signs of pain, such as \"lameness, lethargy or inappetence\" and contact a veterinarian if they are concerned, he advised. You should never tell the cat off or punish them for hissing. \"Instead, see it as them saying 'back off' or 'stop that'. Think about things from their perspective and try to see if they are unhappy,\" Todd said. If your cat is hissing due to reluctance towards certain routine tasks (like grooming them or putting them in their cat carrier to go to the veterinarian's office), devise a plan to gradually train them to actually like that activity, the author advised. Gently wrapping your cat in a towel can facilitate getting them in the carrier for veterinarian visits. You should also consult your veterinarian for suggestions on how to make the trips easier. \"A lot of people think cats can't be trained, but they can. You just have to be patient, follow a gradual plan\" and there will be \"great rewards,\" Todd said.",

        "title": "Why Does My Cat Bite Me? Here's Why Your Feline Randomly Attacks You",
        "text": "Cats are a wonderful addition to any household, with the pets providing warmth, love and a mischievous sense of fun. However, a less welcome trait is when felines attack the humans in their households, seemingly out of the blue. The good news is that by understanding the psychology of why kitties attempt to sink their teeth into our hands, you can help change this behavior. Zazie Todd, author of the upcoming book Purr: The Science of Making Your Cat Happy, reassures readers while is never nice when cats attack, \"there's plenty you can do.\" She told Newsweek: \"It involves paying close attention to your cat's body language so that you learn to recognize the signs before it happens, and it also helps to give your cat choices. \"There are several things that could be going on if it seems that your cat is attacking you at random.\" Why does your cat bite you? Newsweek asked the experts about why your pet can occasionally cross the line between healthy interaction and aggressive play. Why Does My Cat Bite Me Unprovoked? There are at least six reasons why your cat may be biting or attacking you and some of them may be your fault! Play Mode Pam Johnson-Bennett, author and Cat Behavior Associates expert, describes felines as \"predators stimulated by the scent, sight or sound of potential prey.\" Typically, outdoor cats who depend on hunting for survival would engage in a number of attempts each day. Cats who are safely kept indoors still retain that prey drive but are often left with no way to release that energy. She told Newsweek: \"If a cat isn't receiving adequate stimulation and play opportunities through frequent play opportunities and environmental enrichment, they may finally have to get out all that built up energy toward any detected movement. \"Sometimes, that movement is the cat owner's feet or ankles. This is a sign that the cat needs more constructive and beneficial ways to engage and satisfy the prey drive.\" She added a simple solution to this unwanted act of aggression for interactive play sessions with cat toys conducted at least twice daily. Johnson-Bennett added: \"Use a fishing pole-type toy to put a distance between the cat's teeth/claws and the owner's hands. This type of play will allow the cat to fully enjoy what it means to be a hunter.\" Unwanted Petting Zazie Todd notes how many cat owners anecdotally observe that felines occasionally will attack when being petted. She said: \"This is a sign that the petting has gone on for too long or was unwanted, and the cat would like you to stop. \"Cats generally prefer shorter petting sessions so when you're stroking your cat, aim to keep it short and sweet. \"Always give your cat the choice of walking away if they prefer not to be stroked. \"It's also best to encourage the cat to come to you to be stroked, rather than you going to them.\" Cat expert Celia Haddon adds how some cats simply \"do not like being touched in parts of the body\" and a felines' body language is misinterpreted by their masters. She told Newsweek: \"Cats sometimes lie down in front of you in what is a friendly gesture. But it does not mean they want a tummy rub. Try it and they will rake you with their claws. \"The parts of the body that cats often do not like being touched are the belly, the backside under the tail, and lower down the back just before the tail. Some also hate their paws being caressed. \"The best place to pet a cat is gently on the cheeks or under the chin. If you pet them in the wrong area they may nip.\" Lack of Human Interaction During Early Ages Haddon adds cats have, for whatever reason, sometimes had insufficient contact with humans in kittenhood, which can manifest as bad behavior. She said: \"They need to meet humans in the first eight weeks of their lives and if they don't they will be frightened of humans. \"Normally they will run away and hide under the bed. But if you fish them out from under, they will bite or scratch. \"Given a choice between flight and fight they will normally choose flight. But if they can't escape then they will stand and fight. \"The signs that a cat is frightened are ears swivelling down the side of the head, body crouched and tense, feet under the body ready to run, tail low and between the legs.\" Scaredy Cats Zazie Todd believes another, more intuitive, possibility for a painful nip on the fingers is \"your cat is afraid of you or something you're doing.\" She said: \"Cats prefer to run and hide when something is stressful, but if that's not possible then they may feel they have to fight. \"So stop what you're doing and figure out how to help your cat. For example, if you have to put them in their carrier to go to the vet, you might be able to gently wrap them in a towel and put them in that way. \"Then in future, you can train your cat to like going in their carrier, and keep the carrier out at all times so that it becomes a place they can relax in.\" \"You can also speak to your vet about how to make vet visits easier for your cat.\" Redirected Aggression Celia Haddon counsels a sudden attack may not be the fault of the human at all and could just be the case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. She said: \"They might attack you because they saw another cat through the window, wanted to attack it but when you came close to them, they turned on you. \"Redirected aggression. Or you picked them up during a catfight – always dangerous! \"They are full of rage about something else, but you get in the way. \"Rage and anger in either cats or humans takes time to simmer down. If you must intervene in a catfight use something like the bottom cushion of a sofa and put it between the two bodies. Do not use hands.\" Fear / Old Age Ashley Moss of Embrace Pet Insurance boasting six years of technician experience in veterinary neurology and emergency medicine believes it is sometimes justified by concern it may be about to come under attack. She told Newsweek: \"When a cat is unprovoked and attacks a human, it is usually because this cat, was in what I like to call, \"alert mode\" for a perceived threat. \"A perceived threat to our cat is not always identifiable to us, it could be something such as hearing a noise outside or a pen that fell on the floor and is often something that does not signal danger to us but may signal danger to our cat. \"The greater the perceived threat the more focused they become, so much that they may not recognize their loving owner's hand coming for a pet, which in turn leads to them attacking their human's hand.\" Haddon suspects old age may be linked to being more fearful about perceived threats than usual. She said: \"If a previously friendly cat starts attacking it may be in pain and be fearful about humans touching it. \"This is particularly likely in an older cat with arthritis or some other disease of old age.\" And Pam Johnson-Bennett appears to agree, adding how if the attacks are displays of aggression, \"it's important for the cat to have a veterinary check-up because there may be an underlying medical reason for the behavior. This is an important step that shouldn't be overlooked.\" How to Stop My Cat From Biting and Attacking Me Zazie Todd suggests there are several warning signs to watch for while you're stroking your cat. She said: \"[These] include them staring at your hand, their tail twitching or thrashing, or the skin rippling. \"If you watch your cat's body language, you can learn to stop stroking at the first sign they are finding it too much.\" Celia Haddon agrees, adding it is important to be armed with the reasons for attacks, as well as the warning signs. She said: \"Attacks by cats are rarely random. It's just that humans do not see the signs that it is coming. Zazie Todd also notes it is important to respect your kitty, no matter how annoying and even painful their bizarre behavior can be. She said: \"Never punish your cat because it risks damaging their relationship with you and making them feel stressed or anxious. \"If they seem to be attacking you at random, it's up to you to look for clues and figure out what is going on, then do something to help your cat feel more comfortable.\"",

        "text": "Playing with your cat is great for bonding and keeping your pet stimulated and active.Cats need the mental stimulation and companionship provided by play, according to the American Association of Feline Practitioners.The AAFP said studies had found that \"cats play best and most often with toys which also use human interaction.\" Rotated or new toys tend to hold their interest for longer, it advised.Below, animal behavior experts reveal some of the best games to keep your cat entertained.1. The Wand ChaseThis involves using a fishing pole-type toy and encouraging the cat to chase the target at the end.Cat behavior consultant and author Pam Johnson-Bennett told Newsweek that this kind of interactive play, in which the animals use \"their brain to stalk, plan and pounce,\" is one of the best ways to provide physical exercise, emotional satisfaction and mental stimulation.\"Cats are hunters and the most beneficial way to play with them is to mimic how they hunt prey,\" she said.Zazie Todd, author of the book Purr: The Science of Making Your Cat Happy, also praised the wand chase, telling Newsweek: \"This is a really fun game for both the owner and the pet and helps to engage your cat's predatory instinct.\"Another advantage of this game is that it keeps a safe distance between your hands and a cat's teeth and claws, pointed out Johnson-Bennett.Move the wand around like a prey animal and get your cat to watch it first before it pounces and gives chase, bearing in mind that \"prey doesn't typically run up to the cat,\" Todd said.In order to keep the game rewarding, Johnson-Bennett suggested that you allow the cat several successful \"captures.\" Move the wand across or away from the cat's visual field (mimicking the way prey would move) and don't dangle the toy in the cat's face.\"Cats are ambush hunters so they rely on stealth and accuracy for successful hunting,\" she said. \"Don't keep the wand in constant motion or it will limit how much the cat can stalk and plan.\"End the game by winding down the action, \"almost as if the prey is injured,\" before letting the cat have \"a final grand capture,\" said Johnson-Bennett.Interactive play also builds trust between cats and their owners, helping the cat to make positive associations with the owner's presence, she added.2. Follow the TargetTodd suggested using a target game to test your cat's agility. Teach the pet to follow your hand or a stick by putting the target nearby and giving the animal a small food reward whenever it comes close.Once it has got the hang of this, you can move your hand (or the stick) a bit further away and reward the cat when it approaches the target.Over time it will learn to follow the target and you can use this to move your cat around, whether it's jumping on and off furniture, going under objects or through a cat tunnel, she said.3. Catch Me If You Can\"Often a cat will stand at one end of a hallway and look back at you as they take a few steps away. This is a cue that they would like to be chased,\" Vicki Jo Harrison, the president of the International Cat Association, told Newsweek.It's important to read your cat's body language. Be sure your cat's tail is up, which means they're having a good time. \"If their tail is down, it could be a sign that they are afraid,\" she added.4. Puzzle Feeder\"As hunters, cats understand working for food,\" said Johnson-Bennett, so puzzle feeders that your cat has to manipulate to access treats \"help add activity and enrichment.\"There are many puzzle feeders available, offering various levels of difficulty and dispensing wet or dry food.The object of the game is to be \"fun and challenging but not frustrating,\" Johnson-Bennett added. \"For cats who tend to eat too quickly or who tend to camp out at the food bowl, puzzle feeders can be helpful in addition to being fun.\"5. Treat HuntingIn this game, your cat has to follow scents to track down treats. Shut your cat out of a room and then spread four or five cardboard boxes across the floor. Place a treat in each one before letting your cat back in to find the snacks.If you don't have enough cardboard boxes, try hiding a treat inside an empty toilet paper roll, Harrison suggested.When your cat has found all the treats, you can repeat the game. Once it seems to have mastered finding multiple treats, you can try placing a treat in just one of the boxes, rewarding your cat with more treats when it discovers the snack, Todd said.\"Don't pick your cat up\" during the game, she advised. \"If they don't start to engage with the boxes, encourage them to explore them, but always give them a choice.\"6. Hide and SeekYou can play hide and seek using cardboard boxes, tunnels or empty paper bags.\"An empty carton or box can be the best game to entertain your cat at home,\" said Harrison. \"Cats can decide when to enter and play, or you can add toys or treats inside to entice play. There's no limit to the fun you can create with these items.\"If you have lots of empty boxes, she suggested linking them together to form a maze with different passageways for your cat to explore.7. Fetch\"Cats enjoy playing fetch just as much as dogs,\" said Harrison.Choose a toy that can be thrown to the other side of the room. It should be soft rather than firm, hard or plastic, and small enough for your cat to carry in its mouth, she added.Pick a quiet place to play fetch and use a toy that your cat really loves. Throw the toy a short distance away and give the cat a treat when they either go to the toy or sniff the toy, Todd suggested.Once it has got the hang of the game, wait until the cat is \"touching the toy and then later picking it up\" before offering up the treat. Over time, you can gradually teach the cat to bring the toy back to you, she said.8. Bouncing BallsA simple table tennis ball can keep your cat entertained for hours, according to charity International Cat Care. It's lightweight so will not cause any damage around the house or endanger the cat. It's also an appropriate size for a cat's paw.Try throwing the ball up some stairs to encourage your cat to chase it. You can also drop it gently from the top of the stairs, allowing your cat to watch it bounce from step to step, the charity suggests.Even homemade balls, such as a ball of yarn or paper crumpled into a ball, are entertaining, Harrison said. Be sure to dispose of them after a play session so they don't become a hazard, she added.Toy mice and balls that make sounds are great for cats, Harrison said. \"It is important to remember to rotate their toys for variety and to keep them interested.\"How Often Should I Play With My Cat?\"Playing with your cat for 10 to 15 minutes a few times a day is essential to keep indoor cats' natural instincts satisfied,\" Harrison said. \"Keeping your cat entertained will not only keep them happy and healthy but will also strengthen your relationship with them.\"Short bursts of activity at frequent intervals work well, according to International Cat Care.Your cat will let you know if it's not enjoying play time. When your cat gets bored, put the toys away and praise it with a few treats, advised PetMD.Providing an enriched environment for your feline friends can \"increase activity, decrease mental stagnation and prevent many behavioral issues,\" the AAFP said.Play time is especially important for cats that don't venture outdoors, where they can find various kinds of stimulation. The AAFP said you should play with indoor cats several times a day.",

        "text": "Has your cat been moving more slowly, sleeping more than usual and losing interest in play time? It's not uncommon for pets—or their owners—but if your feline friend has become overweight, you might need to put it on a diet.Vicki Jo Harrison, president of the International Cat Association (TICA), told Newsweek that a cat is at risk of developing \"serious medical conditions\" if it is just 2 pounds above its ideal body weight.Zazie Todd, author of Purr: The Science of Making Your Cat Happy, also described obesity as \"a growing problem for cats.\"The health problems suffered by overweight cats include: Type 2 diabetes Osteoarthritis (a degenerative joint disease) High blood pressure Heart disease Breathing difficulties Increased risk of joint injuries. Intra-abdominal cancers. Below, vets and other cat health specialists explain how and when to put your cat on a diet.Signs a Cat Needs a DietBody ConditionDr. Bruce Kornreich, director of the Feline Health Center at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine, told Newsweek that a cat can be given a body condition score.This \"semi-subjective\" scoring system is based on attributes such as the ability to see and feel the cat's ribs or the bones of their spine, as well as the presence of a waist or \"abdominal fat pad.\"The most commonly used scale ranges from 1 to 9, with 1 signifying \"emaciated\" and 9 \"extremely obese.\" An ideal score on this scale is a 5, Kornreich said. \"The body condition score is best used in consultation with a veterinarian.\"WeightEach cat has an ideal weight for its size and breed, Harrison said. You can find more information about this data at the TICA website.A cat is considered overweight when it weighs 10 to 20 percent more than its ideal body weight, explain Dr. Krista Williams and Dr. Robin Downing in an article on the website of animal hospital chain VCA. A cat is obese if it weighs 20 percent or more above the ideal.Harrison listed nine signs that your cat is overweight: Ribs that cannot easily be felt when running your hand along your cat's side. Loss of a visible waist. Collar needs loosening. Difficulty walking. Slow movement. Shortness of breath. Bad temper. Sleeping more than usual. Loss of interest in playing frequently. Grooming and DiseaseAnother indicator that your cat needs a diet change is that it cannot groom some areas of its body properly because it can no longer reach them, according to Kornreich.Diseases more likely to occur in overweight cats or ones that are made more difficult to treat in these cats include diabetes mellitus (a disease of the pancreas) and osteoarthritis. These can also indicate your cat should go on a diet, he said.What Is a Healthy Diet for a Cat?Pam Johnson-Bennett, a cat behavior expert and author of Think Like a Cat, told Newsweek: \"Cats are carnivores so a healthy diet must include protein from animal sources.\"Kornreich suggested consulting a veterinarian and/or veterinary nutritionist to ensure the cat food you buy provides \"a nutritionally complete and balanced diet.\"\"Proprietary cat foods that are nutritionally complete and balanced for the life stage of a cat—kitten versus adult—will have a label from the American Association of Feed Control Officials on their packaging stating this,\" he explained.Talking to the vet is especially important for cats that need a specific diet to address a health concern—such as to dissolve urinary stones, limit carbohydrates if they're diabetic or avoid proteins that cause allergic reactions—Kornreich added.He also warned against raw diets for cats. \"Some of these may contain pathogens like bacteria and/or parasites that may be harmful to cats and their owners.\"How to Put Your Cat on a Diet EffectivelyTalk to Your VeterinarianHarrison, Johnson-Bennett and Todd all advised cat owners to consult their veterinarian to create a safe weight loss program.A veterinarian can work out an appropriate amount of weight loss for your cat and how many calories it needs each day.Once the veterinarian has determined that your cat should lose weight, \"the development of a feeding program to promote weight loss must be undertaken very carefully,\" Kornreich said.This plan can be developed around the diet the cat is already following, he added. But in some cases, specialized weight-loss diets may be recommended.Kornreich also suggested that cat owners try the Cornell Feline Health Center's app, which allows users to generate and track the progress of a feeding plan designed to \"safely promote weight loss in overweight cats using proprietary foods of their choice.\" The iOS app should be used in consultation with a veterinarian, he added.Go at a Slow, Gradual PaceThere can be \"serious medical issues\" if a cat shed pounds too quickly, Todd warned. Johnson-Bennett pointed out that drastic diets can put cats at risk of hepatic lipidosis, a serious liver condition.Underfed cats are prone to this condition, Kornreich explained, during which \"fats are mobilized and accumulate inside the liver cells, negatively impacting their myriad vital functions.\"Hepatic lipidosis can be fatal or cause severe illness, so owners must seek guidance from a veterinary professional if their cat needs to lose weight.\"Cats should not lose more than between 0.5 and 2 percent of their body weight per week,\" he said. \"Owners of overweight cats should understand that it can take significant amounts of time—commonly many months to over a year—for a cat to achieve an ideal weight.\"Use Puzzle FeedersJohnson-Bennett recommended incorporating puzzle feeders into the daily routine of cats that are on diets. These food-dispensing toys must be physically manipulated by the cat in order to retrieve an edible reward.\"Puzzle feeders are great for cats who eat too quickly or have difficulty waiting for the next scheduled meal\" as well as providing increased activity, she said.Cut Out TreatsHarrison suggested starting a cat's weight-loss program by \"cutting out all treats and tidbits,\" including milk, for two weeks.Stick to Smaller, Frequent MealsIt's also a good idea to divide your cat's food into smaller, more frequent meals to help manage their hunger, said Harrison. \"Just make sure you keep track of what, and how much, you're feeding,\" she added.Johnson-Bennett also recommended this technique, pointing out that this is how cats would \"naturally eat in a free-range environment, as small predators who hunt small prey.\"Adjust Portion SizesAfter the first two weeks of the diet, check your cat's body condition and continue the diet until they've reached their ideal weight, advised Harrison.\"Once your cat has reached their perfect shape and size, you can look at slightly adjusting their feeding quantities to stabilize their weight for the future,\" she said.Don't Forget About ExerciseRemember that \"it's not just increased feedings and treats that impact your cat's weight,\" said Harrison. \"A lack of exercise can add extra pounds.\"Johnson-Bennett pointed out that cats, like their owners, will do better if their healthy diet is combined with physical activity. \"Luckily for cats, exercise can come in the form of fun through increased playtime.\"Here are some ways to keep your cat active, suggested by Harrison and Johnson-Bennett: Schedule a daily activity where your cat has to chase a ball, feather wand, flashlight or laser beam on the wall or the floor. Johnson-Bennett suggested engaging in interactive playtime with your cat at least twice a day. \"Customize the intensity of the game based on the cat's current physical ability so it remains fun and beneficial and not frustrating and exhausting,\" she added. Make your cat work for their food by placing it in a slow-release feeding ball. Provide climbing and scratching towers to encourage your cat to take exercise. Place the food in a spot they need to climb to reach, such as a climbing tower or at the top of stairs. Encourage your cat to follow you when you move from room to room, particularly up and down stairs.",
