          "title": "Protecting the natural environment – to enhance tourism, By Folorunsho Coker",
          "text": "Today, I lend my voice to the advocacy of a range of actors across Nigeria and the world, who understand the stakes that we hold in preserving and protecting the natural environment, the ecosystem – with all its shades of biodiversity, and pushing back their deterioration in very intentional ways. The occasion of the World Wildlife Day, which was marked recently on March 3, offered me an opportunity to contemplate the situation of the natural world, which forms a very significant part of what constitutes the tourist experience, and the native space for those of us who work in tourism. This is so, particularly, as nature continues to witness a series of impacts that have led to the concerns of climate change – evident in heat storms, rising water levels and massive floods, desertification, etc., which are all fundamentally altering the environment that we have come to know, celebrate and work with. Also, there continues to be the huge biodiversity loss, in terms of the relentless decimation of stocks of wildlife, including the flora and fauna that have enhanced the beauty of the natural ecosystem and brought balance to it. Our continued preoccupation with experiencing the natural – and even the built – environment through tourism can only be possible and sustainable if and when we are in tune with the emergency that is increasingly getting sounded on its decline, and those of many elements within it, and then making the critical efforts required to mitigate these. Today, I lend my voice to the advocacy of a range of actors across Nigeria and the world, who understand the stakes that we hold in preserving and protecting the natural environment, the ecosystem – with all its shades of biodiversity, and pushing back their deterioration in very intentional ways. No doubt, the depletion of the atmospheric ozone layer in the march of the progress of mankind, through the great industrial revolutions and our habits of consumption that followed, resulted in the global warming that has left the climate patterns unhinged. This has been attendant upon the upsurge of greenhouse gases from the burning of hydrocarbons, as much as it has been due to industrial emissions, deforestation, alongside other environmentally-impacting economic activities. Consequently, in the past century, not only have our rainforests consistently depleted, even the savannahs and mangrove forests have altered considerably, while an increasing hot Sahel has continued its encroachment, in tandem with the loss of our biodiversity – plants, animals, the various species of wildlife, which are either dying or moving elsewhere in huge waves of transcontinental migration. Nigeria’s Biodiversity Endowment – and Loss The Nigerian biodiversity endowment has equally been a critical form of the endowment of tourism from time immemorial, motivating people to make journeys to locations where certain species of animals or plants were/are in existence, both for nutritional and therapeutic purposes. And, while the increases in human population continuously intensified the need for gaming, hunting and the harvesting of these biodiversity resources, it significantly engendered the trajectory of their loss, and hence the resounding need for protection. The treasure trove of Nigeria’s biodiversity has been documented as including almost eight thousand plant species, spread across over 300 families and more than 2,200 genera. Also, some 22,000 species of vertebrate and invertebrate species, comprising some 20,000 insects, over 1,000 birds, 1,000 fishes, 123 reptiles and 247 mammals. Furthermore, almost 1,500 species of microorganisms have been recorded, as essential to the remarkable biodiversity endowment of the country, from the arid North to the wetlands of the Southern Nigeria, and the different vegetation subsets in between. …the 2022 edition of the World Wildlife Day speaks to the urgency of reversing the loss of the planet’s critical biodiversity and the restoration of their habitats and the broader ecosystem. The recognition of the need to conserve our wildlife and other key animal and plant species in Nigeria, led to the creation of a network of protected areas, including a biosphere reserve, nine national parks, over 400 forest reserves, about 30 games reserves and close to a dozen nature reserves. Despite the variety and range of these treasures, the activities of man in driving the wheels of progress and advancement, as alluded to earlier, have led to huge losses in our biodiversity in the past century. While a lot of the species have been lost permanently, many more remain under the continuous threats of poaching, illegal gaming/hunting and climate change, etc. As such, a number of the Nigerian wildlife have been marked as endangered species, include the ostrich, gorilla, grey parrot, genera of crocodiles, African manatee, chimpanzee, giraffe, the white-throated guenon, African bush elephant, hippopotamus, water chevrotain, Ariel gazelle, and African rock python, among others. Species of plants/trees under the threat of enduring loss include the African teak, the F.White or Diospyros elliotii (Hiern), African whitewood, fennel flower (or Nigella sativa), the sausage tree or Kigelia, traditional chewing stick or Masilania accuminata, and then the Garcina manni, Oucunbaca aubrevillei, Erythrina senegalensis, Cassia nigricans, and the Hymenocardia acida, etc. Halting the Biodiversity Decline and Loss It was in recognition of the great value of the animal biodiversity of the world, their invaluable significance, contributions to the balance of the ecosystem, and alarm at their gradual extinction, due to natural and man-made factors, that the World Wildlife Day was finally created in December 2013. This came about as a proclamation of the 68th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which adopted the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and declared March 3 as the day to raise awareness about and celebrate the world’s heritage of wildlife and wild flora and fauna. While it has been projected that over a million species of wild fauna and flora, alongside wildlife, are critically in danger of extinction, this motivated the designation of the theme of the 2022 World Wildlife Day as “Recovering key species for ecosystem restoration” to promote the need for the conservation and protection of these endangered species. And, this aligns with and enhances the grand objectives of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, 12, 13, 14, and 15, which all affirm the necessity of commitments towards the sustainable use of the world’s resources and their conservation. As such, the 2022 edition of the World Wildlife Day speaks to the urgency of reversing the loss of the planet’s critical biodiversity and the restoration of their habitats and the broader ecosystem. The recognition of the need to conserve our wildlife and other key animal and plant species in Nigeria, led to the creation of a network of protected areas, including a biosphere reserve, nine national parks, over 400 forest reserves, about 30 games reserves and close to a dozen nature reserves. Whilst the British established many of the forest reserves that were later turned into national parks and conservation zones, which are growing hubs of tourism, yet the urgency of now necessitates that we all sustain this legacy by taking our commitments to the preservation and restoration of the natural environment more seriously – as we do and exhort others to at the National Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC) – in order for us to continuously relish all that our biodiversity and environment have to offer. Landscapes of Natural Tourism Assets Besides the various areas mentioned above, such as the forest and games reserves, some of the major protected areas for wildlife and biodiversity in Nigeria are the nine national parks, which are cumulatively spread across some 2.4 million hectares of land in the country. As remarkable spheres of conservation and eco-tourism destinations, these parks are natural habitats for over 1,300 animal species, including over 800 birds, in addition to hundreds of unique fauna and flora. These diverse ecological domains, incorporating numerous cultural and historical monuments, comprise the Chad Basin National Park in North-Eastern Nigeria, which consists of the Sambisa Game Reserve and the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands; the Cross River National Park, including the Okwangwo and Oban sections that traverse some 4,000 square kilometres of rainforests to the north and central parts and the mangrove swamps in the coastal areas. There is also the Gashaka-Gumti National Park, which is the largest in the country, as a composite of two games reserves, which run from the eastern parts of Taraba and Adamawa States and as far as the Nigerian borders with Cameroon; and the Kainji National Park straddling Niger and Kwara States. This includes the Kainji Lake, where fishing is restricted, the Zuguruma Game Reserve to the southeast and the Borgu Game Reserve to the west, all spanning an areas of 5,341 square kilometres. The Kamuku National Park in Kaduna State covers a total landmass of 1,120 square kilometres, with an ecology that’s mainly of the Sudan Savanna, while the Old Oyo National Park runs through the northern part of Oyo State and the southern part of Kwara State. There are equally the Jos Wildlife National Park in Plateau State, North-Central, Nigeria and the Yankari National Park in Bauchi State, extending to the North-Eastern parts of the country, and the Okomu National Park in the Ovia South-West Local Government Area of Edo State. This is an expanse of forest that ranges over 1,082 square kilometres of land. In as much as our current efforts at the conservation and protection of our biodiversity, such as the animal wildlife, alongside the peculiar fauna and flora of our ecosystem, and natural habitats, have a history starting with the earlier British colonial administration in Nigeria, we are certainly obliged to deepen this. And, this has been one of the cardinal objectives of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari in its policies on the natural environment, whose balance we all need for sustenance on earth and to keep enjoying the experiences of tourism. This not only aligns with international standards and ideals, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, but it is also about real pragmatism and good economics. Whilst the British established many of the forest reserves that were later turned into national parks and conservation zones, which are growing hubs of tourism, yet the urgency of now necessitates that we all sustain this legacy by taking our commitments to the preservation and restoration of the natural environment more seriously – as we do and exhort others to at the National Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC) – in order for us to continuously relish all that our biodiversity and environment have to offer. The Future of Our World, and Tourism, is Feminist I will not end this essaying around the necessity for the protection of nature and the environment without offering a resounding salutation to our womenfolk, who do much of the work of tourism, directly and through its associated sectors, in the spirit of the International Women’s Day 2022 (IWD) that was just held on March 8. It is without doubt that women not only constitute about half of the population of the world, and Nigeria, but they are unfortunately still weighed down by the burdens of tradition, conventions and society, which delimits their potentials and possibilities. One way to unshackle the future that we strive towards and enable its diverse prospects, is for all of us to become feminist, and support our womenfolk in unleashing their various abilities and capabilities, as they keep breaking all the bias strewn in their paths. So help us God. Folorunsho Coker is the Director General of the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC) and chief marketer of the Nigerian destination.",

          "title": "Iconic African game to be focus at world wildlife conference",
          "text": "MOMBASA, Kenya -- Iconic African wildlife such as elephants, big cats and rosewood trees will be central to discussions of the World Wildlife Conference slated for Panama later this year. The standing committee meeting of the UN wildlife trade body, called the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which met all of last week in Lyon, France, slated these animals and trees for the main agenda of discussion during the Panama wildlife conference, scheduled for November. The wildlife body is the highest decision-making organ on global wildlife trade. It is expected to make decisions on the resolutions set in Lyon on flagship wildlife including pangolins, West African vultures, parrots orchids, seahorses, marine turtles, Malagasy ebonies, sharks and rays. 'œAfrican nations are providing a strong example to the world of how states can collaboratively take action against illegal international trade in wildlife,\" said Ivonne Higuero, the secretary general of the UN wildlife agency. '\ufffdIn Central and West Africa, there is a new political commitment and engagement to combat the illegal trade endangered species of wild animals and plants.'\ufffd Higuero added that African countries had led by example in instituting the African Carnivore Initiative, which aims to conserve lions, leopards, cheetahs and the African wild dog species. The powerful UN wildlife agency makes three distinctions for listing of wildlife according to the degree of protection needed. It also spells out commercial rules covering over 38,000 species of plants and animals, requiring member states to penalize any violation of the procedures that it sets. Each October since 2017, member states have been required to submit data on all seizures of wildlife made in the previous year. Nearly 6,000 species have been seized between 1999-2018, ranging from mammals, reptiles, corals, birds, and fish according to the UN crime office records. The World Wildlife Seizures Database, which is a global repository of reported wildlife confiscations compiled by the UN office on drugs and crime, is the main tool used to review worldwide illegal commercial trends. Between 1999 and 2018, there were over 180,000 seizures, covering 6,000 species spread across 149 countries represents the network of illegal wildlife trade, according to the database. Poaching and trafficking records indicate that ivory trade saw a resurgence around 2007 and grew steadily until around 2011, before declining in 2016. The estimated number of elephants in African countries in 2006 was 556,973. This number has since decreased to the current 413,242. Trends of wildlife trophy seizures accumulated in the last four years reveal that there has been a shift in ivory shipments, with Lagos Port in Nigeria dominating exports and Vietnam leading as main elephant tusks importer. Previously, the Mombasa Port in Kenya held the primacy of illicit ivory shipments and China took the lead as the main importer. UN records also indicate that the \"largest flow of illicitly harvested rosewood in the past four years is coming out of Africa.'\ufffd Global imports of tropical hardwood logs totaled 18 million cubic meters in 2018, valued at over US$ 3 billion. Some 82 % of the value of this import demand came from industries based in China, which currently leads the world in furniture manufacturing. Up until 2013, one of the more prominent non-Asian sources for rosewood was Madagascar, where at least 48 species are known to occur with 47 of them being widespread on the Indian Ocean island nation. A recommendation to suspend trade in species of rosewood from Madagascar was made in 2016 and remains in place to this day. 'œThe rosewood crisis has been devastating West African forests and the livelihoods of its people for almost a decade,'\ufffd said Raphael Edou, the Africa program manager of the environmental group. In 2018, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature classified redwood as 'œendangered.\" China, Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, the European Union, Japan and Malaysia remain the main destinations of trafficked rosewood, accounting for three-quarters of all logs seized globally. Pangolins in Africa are increasingly being hunted for their meat and their scales. The bulk of pangolin exports come from Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo and Gabon. According to the wildlife database, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Congo-Brazzaville are hubs and logistics nodes of pangolins' transshipment in Africa, with China as the largest importer. In 2016 due to overexploitation of pangolins, the wildlife body placed a global trade ban. While the Lyon standing committee this last week highlighted the plight of Africa's wildlife, decisions aimed at curbing illegal trade and the future of the continent's iconic species will be decided by officials at the Panama conference. ____ Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

          "text": "Donegal County Council has helped produce a new video which highlights the importance of the built environment for wildlife and celebrates the species which have adapted to live alongside us and share our homes. The nature documentary also highlights the measures that we can take to ensure we make space for nature and showcases some of our most iconic wildlife species which are reliant on buildings for their survival. BirdWatch Ireland and CrowCrag Productions produced this feature to raise awareness of the importance of buildings for many of our wildlife, in partnership with Donegal County Council. Breaking down the barriers that only people live in buildings, and wildlife lives in “nature”, this video illustrates that for as long as people have built structures for protection and shelter, wildlife has taken advantage of these buildings for the very same reasons. John Lusby, BirdWatch Ireland, said, “At a time when retrofitting of buildings is proposed at large scale to tackle climate change, and we are losing many of our older stone structures, we wanted to highlight the importance of buildings for wildlife and to create a better link between our built environment and our natural heritage – as the two are intertwined. “The diversity of species which use buildings and the ways in which they have adapted to use the built environment are astonishing. As the built environment is constantly changing, we need to make sure that we avoid disturbance to sensitive species and also to continue to provide space for wildlife in buildings, which has benefits for wildlife as well as ourselves. “We hope that this video increases awareness and appreciation of the importance of the built environment for wildlife and provides the necessary information to help conserve some of our most vulnerable and iconic wildlife which are dependent on buildings for their survival.” Certain species are expected residents within our buildings, and for some the association with buildings is apparent even from their names, such as the ‘House Martin’ which builds its mud nest in the apex of the roof of occupied houses, and the ‘Barn Swallow’ which nest in farmyards throughout the country. The vision of a Barn Owl floating silently from a ruined castle at dusk may seem familiar, but less expected occupants may be a pair of Kestrels nesting in a flower box outside a busy kitchen window, or a female Pine Marten raising her kits in the roof space of an occupied dwelling. Of course, much of the wildlife which use buildings go unnoticed, such as bats roosting in the attic of a house in which the inhabitants beneath remain blissfully unaware of their presence. Given the importance of buildings for wildlife, changes to the built environment can affect wildlife associated with it. Wildlife in buildings can often be harmed during works due to a lack of awareness of their presence or indeed knowledge of how plan renovations and works in order to avoid disturbance, which is almost always possible. The loss of old stone structures due to demolition, dilapidation or renovation is linked to declines in species such as Barn Owl and Swift, which are dependent on these structures. Modern buildings do not provide the same opportunities for wildlife. However, there is a lot that we can do to improve modern buildings for wildlife to ensure that we continue to make space for nature. ‘Wildlife in Buildings: linking our built and natural heritage’ was produced by BirdWatch Ireland, Kerry County Council and Donegal County Council, with funding from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the National Biodiversity Action Plan Fund.",

          "title": "Dundee is in top four most wildlife-friendly cities in the UK",
          "text": "Dundee ranks among the top four most wildlife-friendly cities in the UK, according to new data. Gayle Ritchie finds out more. As our towns and cities continue to expand and encroach upon natural habitats, wild animals, bugs, birds and beasties increasingly rely upon safe havens in our gardens and among urban spaces. So Scotland should be proud of itself because a new report reveals that its cities occupy three of the top five spots in a wildlife-friendly cities index. While Edinburgh takes the top spot, Greater London is second on the list, Aberdeen is third, and Dundee is fourth. (The other places are taken by Stoke-on-Trent (5th), Telford (6th), Birmingham and Wolverhampton (7th), Newcastle (8th), Milton Keynes (9th) and Southend (10th). The report states that while Dundee “has potential three times greater than some other UK urban areas for rewilding and becoming wildlife-friendly” that it also has the second highest percentage of woodland area of all UK cities – critical to supporting wildlife. The research found that an impressive 10.5% of Dundee’s area is “functional green space”, nearly double that of other places in the UK. The study, collated by bird food specialists Ark Wildlife, analysed the latest Defra data to calculate the amount of existing wildlife-friendly natural land area. It also collated data on green space, which highlights the potential to develop rewilding projects within the boundaries of each urban area. The data looked at woodland, waterways and average garden size for the public to support wildlife. Encouraging wildlife David Noble, founder of Dundee garden design and landscape services Noble Landscapes, is greatly encouraged by the findings. Asked how people in cities and urban environments can encourage wildlife into their green spaces, he says: “For those with a larger garden, letting an area grow into a wildflower meadow will encourage butterflies, bees and other wildlife.” And he suggests not worrying about fully cutting such meadows back in autumn. “Leaving some stems and litterfall can help feed and shelter wildlife over winter,” he says. “But if you don’t have a lot of space, try a wildflower planter instead. Even the tiniest gardens and balconies can welcome wildlife with a bird feeder or insect hotel.” Mark Bowdler, horticultural manager at Dobbies’ Dundee store, isn’t surprised by the new data as wildlife-friendly flowers and seeds are popular with customers. “Wildflower gardens have been really popular this spring and our customers in Dundee are looking at ways in which they can create a welcoming space for bumblebees, butterflies and other wildlife alike,” he says. “You don’t need to have a big space to create a pollination haven in the garden, and we’d recommend allocating a corner of your garden to plant up a selection of suitable plants. Our favourites include lupins, foxgloves and lavender – all will attract the wildlife to your back garden. You can also grow wildflowers from seeds and we offer good value ranges for anyone wanting to take their first steps into wildlife-friendly gardening.” Designing ‘natural gardens’ Dundee-based landscape and garden designer Robert Furmanek says designing “natural gardens” has become a dominant gardening trend. “Creating natural gardens helps to prevent a decline in biodiversity, loss of natural habitats for animals, water shortages, and progressive environmental pollution,” he explains. “Designing a naturalistic garden is based on imitating what nature itself has created. “A natural garden is not only a plant community, but also a place of living for animals. Various plantings, creating hiding places and feeding bases, favour the presence of hedgehogs, frogs and toads, lizards, birds and squirrels. To make the garden pet-friendly, you can place bird booths and drinkers, hedgehog houses and insect hotels.” Robert says it’s best to use natural decorations and materials such as stone, gravel, and wood and suggests avoiding “extravagant” ornaments, especially those made of plastic. “A naturalistic garden can be decorated with magnificent boulders, boughs or tree trunks blended into vegetation,” he adds. “Choose furniture made of natural materials such as wood, sisal, bamboo. Water reservoirs should be in the form of ponds densely covered with vegetation. “It’s worth planting honey plants such as lungwort or lupins, that attract beneficial insects as well as bushes and trees like rowanberry that provide food and shelter for birds. Birches, lindens, oaks, hornbeams, dogwood, bird cherry, viburnum, hawthorn, virginia creams and wild roses are recommended. Or in forest-like gardens, lilies and heathers work well.” To reproduce fields and meadows, you can plant echinacea, St John’s wort, poppies, mullein, cornflowers, geraniums, goldenrod, sunflowers and cosmos, while plants considered weeds, such as dandelion and nettle, can also grow. Robert adds: “Natural gardens give you the opportunity to get close to nature, and they’re easy to maintain.” The new findings come as there are calls from urban planners for more to be done to make room for wild spaces, particularly in new-build developments which widen urban sprawl. Gardens play a crucial role in supporting species in urban areas, offering a small oasis of greenery in built-up cities, particularly when natural spaces are in short supply. Shocking gap Founder of Ark Wildlife Sean McMenemy says while it’s great to see that many UK cities are helping wildlife to flourish, the gap between the “top” and “bottom” cities is “really quite shocking”. “It just goes to show that there’s always more we can do,” he says. “I hope studies like this can jolt urban planners into action, because there are so many critically endangered species that need help now. And even though there’s so much pressure to create new housing, rewilding and new housing can often go hand in hand. After all, people need green spaces too and easy access to nature is a huge selling point for housing. “Of course, members of the public can help local animals by making their gardens as inviting as can be, whether that involves planting wildflowers or simply adding a birdbath.” John Pemberton, conservation and education development manager at wildlife-friendly landscapers idverde.co.uk says: “It’s essential that wildlife has access to high quality habitat and corridors in our cities for both the benefit of nature and also human health and wellbeing. “Considering the needs of wildlife and biodiversity in the early stages of all decision-making, and treating biodiversity as a genuine priority when making decisions about land use, management, development and care, can prevent ill-considered actions taking place. “This can also ensure that the needs of wildlife are met rather than being treated as an after-thought or a ‘nice to have’. “Many councils have declared climate and, or, ecological emergencies. This is one step in raising awareness, but the next is to ensure that this manifests into meaningful and positive action for nature.” The full report can be found here: arkwildlife.co.uk BRIGHTEN UP GREEN SPACES Dobbies is running an initiative to help brighten up green spaces and encourage wildlife. This spring, its Dundee store will support a sustainable project through its Helping Your Community Grow initiative. In recent months, community projects in Dundee and Angus were invited to nominate themselves for support and now a shortlist has been selected. The winning project will receive advice, products and support from their local Dobbies team. Sustainable products, such as peat-free compost and recycled pots, will be used where possible. Among the shortlisted projects are Baldragon Academy and Newtyle Nursery. A spokesman said: “Baldragon Academy has a vision to teach students and the wider local community the process of growing their own at their school garden space. “The school believes Dobbies’ support would facilitate this project and educate pupils on sustainable practices that can be implemented in the allotment.” Newtyle Nursery in Angus hopes to use Dobbies’ initiative to encourage children to grow their own vegetables so they can enjoy the produce during snack time and learn about a “farm to fork” approach. In addition to the allotment, the nursery hopes to create a sensory garden, where little ones can touch and smell plants. Dobbies’ CEO, Graeme Jenkins, said: “Helping Your Community Grow is a really popular initiative in Dundee and we’ve seen a great response from community groups and projects looking to make a difference to their local area. It’s been positive to see so many projects place importance on sustainability and environmentally-friendly products. “Now the community voting gets under way and we’re looking forward to seeing which projects receive our support.” In addition to the Dundee winner, the project which receives the most votes across the UK will win the national Helping Your Community Grow title, gaining additional support from Dobbies to deliver their project. Voting is open until May 16. For more information on how to register your vote, visit: dobbies.com/helping-your-community-grow",

          "title": "Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary — Home To Biodiversity, Wintering Ground For Seasonal Migration - Global New Light Of Myanmar",
          "text": "By Aung Win Nyein (Kanbalu) Myanmar is rich in natural resources and biodiversity, therefore, legislation and policies are enacted to protect and conserv e the environment. Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary located in Kanbalu and Kawlin townships, Sagaing Region is one of the protected areas for wildlife animals, plant species and ecosystem. Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area of the native bird species, migratory birds in winter, diverse species and Myanmar gol den deer in the dipterocarp forest which is locally known as Indaing. Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary covers 21,908 acres in Kanbalu Township and 42,356.42 acres in Kawlin Township. The sanctuary conserves biodiversity and Indaing ecosystem to contribute towards sustainable development. Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary conservation activities are being implemented with an aim to promote environmental conservation practices, stand as an educational centre for conservation, and enhance the socio-economy of the local community and ecotourism. It is home to critically endangered Myanmar golden deer, six bird species and one reptile species. The rare six bird species are Jerdon’s Minivet, Hooded Treepie, Ayeyawady Bulbul, native Bushlark, white-throated Babbler and native Dove. One rare reptile is the rare flap shell turtle. Moreover, the endangered species such as python, boa, migratory birds, forest bird species and other 787 diverse species are recorded at Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, said U Win Naing, warden of Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary. A total of 10,473 bird species are identified in the world and 1,116 bird species are found in the country. Myanmar is home to many endemic and endangered bird species. Next, 262 bird species (223 forest bird species and 39 waterbird species) are recorded at Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, along with the priceless natural resources. Other 30 migratory bird species including waterbird species such as gull, Spoon-billed sandpiper, woodcock, red-wattled lapwing, greylag goose, and ruddy shelduck, and forest species such as Indian paradise flycatcher, barn swallow, brown shrike, wagtail, Eurasian Wryneck are found at Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary. Migratory birds flock to the Wildlife Sanctuary between October and March. The population of migratory bird species vary every year, according to a bird survey conducted between the 2016-2017 Financial Year and 2020-2021FY. Wetland areas in the Chatting Wildlife Sanctuary are estimated at 1,000 acres in the monsoon period, about 400 acres in winter and 300 acres in summer. The visitors can enjoy bird watching, boat tours, trekking, cycling and observing the animal and plant species. A guesthouse is also located at the sanctuary for a night trip. According to global biodiversity conservation pacts, the Kyayin wetland area in the sanctuary is also a protected land to sustain the habitats of migratory birds. Every year, migratory birds flock to the freshwater lake, where there is abundant food, away from colder regions with frozen lakes and a short food supply that make it difficult for them to survive. The seabirds and bird species from the North Pole migrate for the winter to various countries through nine flyways. They fly from their breeding grounds to wintering grounds to survive. Migration is the regular seasonal movement undertaken by many species of birds. Migratory birds enter Myanmar through two flyways: The central Asian Flyway and East Asia-Australasian Flyway every year. Kyayin wetland area at the Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the safe destinations for migratory birds. As the bird species are warm-blooded animals, the incubation period is June to August. Some birds undergo colour changes in the breeding season. Bird species play a pivotal role in the valuable ecosystem and they defend the crops from the pests and rodents. They also carry out seed dispersal and pollination, resulting in tangible benefits to the people. Bird surveys are conducted each financial year to observe the bird species which move to Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary in winter and undertake a comparative study for the population growth and decline of those migratory birds in each month and year We also endeavour to record certain migratory bird species which choose their wintering spots, and contribute to research and awareness campaigns, said U Win Naing, a warden. Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary is implementing habitat restoration for sustainable development and conserving the migratory birds and other endemic species, awareness campaigns to educate the local community about the importance of biodiversity and patrolling activities for wildlife conservation.

          "title": "Two Decades After It Vanished, The Stunning Spix’s Macaw Returns To Its Forest Home - WorldNewsEra",
          "text": "Curaçá, Brazil—In 1995, conservationists and scientists embarked on a desperate attempt to save the world’s rarest bird, a blue-gray parrot called the Spix’s macaw. The bird had scarcely been spotted since scientists first described it in the early 19th century, and it had taken on an aura of mystery, making it irresistible to parrot lovers—and to poachers. “For well over a century we just had this very, very weak information that there was this kind of mythical, rather beautiful blue bird,” says Nigel Collar, a conservationist at BirdLife International. By the mid-1990s only a single individual remained alive in the wild, close to this dusty, small town in northeastern Brazil. From DNA in molted feathers, researchers in the United Kingdom confirmed that the last wild bird was a male. At the time, fewer than three dozen birds were known to be held in collections and zoos around the world, and a decision was made to release a single female in hopes the birds would pair and produce offspring. The female was released close to where the male lived and seemed to quickly adapt to her new life, eating wild food and avoiding an attack by a falcon. She grew stronger by the day, flying farther and farther, and after little more than 2 months had paired with the male. Two weeks later, she mysteriously disappeared. Years later, a local man said he had found the bird dead below a power line. “If that’s really true, then that is just incredibly bad luck,” Collar says. It is almost unheard of for parrots to hit power cables, he says, and in reality she might have been taken by poachers. “The world of Spix’s macaw is full of very, very great uncertainties and a lot of people who say a lot of things that they don’t necessarily really mean.” The wild male vanished a few years later, and the Spix’s fate seemed sealed—another species lost. Now, conservationists are attempting to undo that fate. On 11 June, more than a quarter-century after the female flew into oblivion, they plan to release eight Spix’s macaws from captivity into the wild. Twelve more are supposed to follow at the end of the year and still more in the years to come. If everything goes according to plan, these birds will be the vanguard of a new population of Spix’s macaws in their natural habitat. The project, long hampered by infighting and overshadowed by controversy, had to overcome significant scientific hurdles to even come this far. But the biggest challenge still lies ahead. “The Spix’s project is unique in that they are reintroducing a species back into the wild that is currently extinct, has been extinct in the wild for over 2 decades,” says Thomas White, a wildlife biologist at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a technical adviser to the project. “There’s very few reintroduction programs around the world that have done something like that, none with parrots or macaws.” Few reintroductions of birds have been successful, and none was as ambitious as this one, says George Amato, a conservation biologist at the American Museum of Natural History. Yet for the Spix’s it has to be tried, he says. “I hope it works, because we really have no other alternatives.” The natural home of the Spix’s macaw is in the caatinga, a tropical dry forest in northeastern Brazil that covers 10% of the country. In the rainy season, which lasts for about 3 months, everything appears lush and green. But the rest of the year plants here compete in shades of gray and white—caatinga means “white forest” in the Indigenous Tupi language. It is here that the Spix’s macaws once nested in the hollows of old caraibeira trees growing along the creeks that cut through the caatinga, feeding on seeds and nuts. It is impossible to know how many Spix’s macaws existed in the past. By the time Western science discovered the bird, humans had already started to parcel large parts of the caatinga into ranches. In 1819, German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix spotted the parrot on an expedition to the interior of Brazil. Spix noted that the bird appeared to be “very rare”—then shot it and brought it home to Munich, setting the tone for humanity’s relationship with this striking bird going forward. As the human footprint increased in the caatinga, the bird became even rarer. Tragically, this only made it more coveted by parrot collectors, who were willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a single bird. “The rarer it was, the more it became a kind of status symbol,” Collar says. The bird became something akin to the exceedingly rare blue Mauritius stamp coveted by philatelists, says Roland Wirth, a conservationist at the Zoological Society for the Conservation of Species and Populations. “The very wealthy, very passionate collectors really wanted to have one, and they would do almost anything to do so.” By the beginning of 1987, only three Spix’s macaws were known to survive in the wild, and by the end of that year, poachers had taken two of them. After the plan to pair the last male with a captive bird failed in 1995, the male remained with a female of a different species, an Illiger’s macaw, until he, too, disappeared in October 2000. The International Union for Conservation of Nature officially declared the Spix’s macaw extinct in the wild in 2019, exactly 200 years after Spix had described it. Even then, the bird retained its hold on the popular imagination. The story of the last lone male inspired songs—including one written from the perspective of the Illiger’s female waiting in vain for his return—and two animated movies that together earned $1 billion. On a hot morning in February, Martin Guth, a bald and burly German businessman and parrot collector, stood in the spot where the Spix’s will begin its new life in the wild. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) he founded, the Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots (ACTP), has taken on the challenge of bringing the bird back to the caatinga. ACTP, which houses more than 170 Spix’s macaws in Tasdorf, near Berlin, built a facility just a few hundred meters from where Guth is standing and, in March 2020, flew 52 macaws to Brazil by private jet to take up residence there. In 2021, three chicks hatched at the facility, the first Spix’s born in the bird’s original home in more than 30 years. But that morning, Guth was angry. Nearby, workers were busy constructing a huge U-shaped aviary where the birds will be able to fly longer distances than they can in their small cages inside the main facility. It was running behind schedule. “Even on the way here, the guy still said everything was finished,” Guth grumbled. He was convinced that a rival who was previously involved in the Spix’s project had something to do with the delay. The Spix’s project may have high-minded goals, but its history is replete with jealousies and backbiting. The idea of breeding Spix’s macaws in captivity and reintroducing them to the wild began long before Guth’s involvement, and even before the lone wild male had disappeared. In 1990, conservationists formed a committee to oversee a reintroduction program. That meant building up an adequate captive population, which proved to be a complicated and controversial process. At first conservationists only knew of a few captive birds—and owners were reluctant to come forward, because the export of wildlife had been illegal in Brazil since 1967. But the Brazilian government agreed to grant amnesty to owners if their birds joined the breeding program, and “one by one, people came out and admitted they had Spix’s macaws,” says Wolfgang Kiessling, a businessman who founded and runs Loro Parque, a private zoo on the island of Tenerife that held some Spix’s macaws for many years. Still, by 1996 only 39 captive birds were known around the world. Making matters worse, most of them were closely related. Only nine of the birds had come from the wild, and 21 of the remaining 30 were offspring from a single pair in the Philippines, raising concerns about inbreeding. For the Spix’s to have any future, birds from different collectors needed to be brought together to breed, but arguments over who would send a bird to whom under what conditions kept derailing the plans. “The rarer the animal, the more politics is involved,” says Cristina Miyaki, a bird geneticist and a member of the advisory committee of the Spix’s project. In contrast to the spirit of cooperation required for a successful recovery effort, Collar wrote in 1992, “ownership is a matter of jealousy, prestige and possessiveness that is fundamentally different in psychological origin.” Meanwhile, the constellation of owners kept changing. Starting in 2000, Sheikh Saoud Bin Mohammed Bin Ali Al-Thani of Qatar bought dozens of Spix’s to keep at Al Wabra, his private wildlife preserve. In time, he came to own the vast majority of all known Spix’s macaws in the world. Guth entered the scene in 2005, beating out the sheikh to buy from a private Swiss owner three Spix’s macaws that had not previously been part of the breeding program. “The three birds he had were the most important ones, because they could improve the genetics of the population,” says Camile Lugarini, a veterinarian at the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), who leads the Spix’s macaw project for the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment. In May 2012, a meeting in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, brought together representatives of all the important stakeholders. It was testy. One participant argued that Guth should have no part in the project because he had served a prison sentence and, this person claimed, had sold endangered birds illegally, in violation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. (Guth says that like other breeders and NGOs, ACTP sells some birds legally, but has never sold Spix’s or other highly endangered birds, and that his offenses were committed decades ago and have nothing to do with the current project.) Tim Bouts, a veterinarian who was then the curator at Al Wabra and attended the meeting, says he spoke in defense of Guth, who was not present: “Let’s be honest, this table here is full of criminals. Every single Spix’s that came into captivity was illegal.” The meeting ended with no agreement. Guth has pressed ahead, even as some have questioned his motives and methods, pointing to the lack of transparency around ACTP and its sources of funding. Guth says some donors prefer to remain anonymous and that he is trying to avoid the disputes over funding and credit that doomed the project in the past. “Yes, we are doing things differently,” he says. “It certainly didn’t work the way they tried it before.” Even some people who say they are intimidated by Guth acknowledge the effectiveness of his pushing, bullying, and cajoling. “He is a bit of a bulldozer,” Wirth says. “But he gets things done.” When the sheikh died suddenly in 2014 and the future of his Spix’s macaws was in doubt, Guth stepped in through his NGO to bring the birds from Qatar to Tasdorf. In June 2018, Guth and Brazil’s environment minister signed a memorandum of understanding in Berlin to build the facility in Brazil, transfer birds, and reintroduce them. (ICMBio and the Pairi Daiza Foundation were also signatories.) “I wasn’t born as a conservationist,” Guth says. But as he became involved in the reintroduction effort, he grew determined to prove his critics wrong. “They said, ‘He won’t be able to breed the birds.’ I did. They said, ‘He won’t send any birds to Brazil.’ I did. They said, ‘He won’t reintroduce the birds.’ We are doing that.” He has put himself in an interesting position, Collar says. “He is the one now who can go down in history as the person who saved the Spix’s macaw. Or if he really messes up, then he goes down in history as the person who made it go extinct.” While owners were fighting over control and credit, conservationists and researchers were fighting to save the species. When ornithologist Cromwell Purchase went to Al Wabra in 2010 to head its Spix’s macaw program, he was told the species was “on the fence.” At the time, 54 of 71 birds known worldwide were in Qatar, and the captive population faced twin threats: disease and a low birth rate. The major disease threatening captive Spix’s was proventricular dilatation disease, which affects the nerves in parrots’ gastrointestinal tract and causes them to slowly waste away. A common scourge of pet birds, it had been known since the 1970s, but its cause was completely unclear. Then, in 2008, researchers identified a novel virus in the brains of affected birds: a type of bornavirus, a group known to cause brain disease in horses and sheep. “We tested all known Spix’s in the world for this virus,” says Michael Lierz, a veterinarian at the Justus Liebig University Giessen. In Qatar, a traffic light system was implemented, with infected birds deemed “red” and separated from the others. This eventually eliminated the threat of avian bornavirus to the Spix’s population. The other problem was reproduction. Only a few pairs were producing chicks. At first a decision was made to keep them reproducing. “The goal was to produce as many animals as possible to keep the species from going completely extinct,” Lierz says. Over time the focus shifted to making better matches, in order to preserve the Spix’s genetic diversity and, therefore, its chances of survival. But birds with diverse genetics wouldn’t necessarily form a pair. “Parrots are monogamous and very choosy,” Lierz says. So, veterinarians at Al Wabra considered artificial insemination. For many birds, including chickens, pigeons, and birds of prey, this is fairly straightforward, Lierz says. The technique involves massaging a male’s cloaca from the outside with the thumb. (“A short and smooth thumbnail is advantageous for performing cloacal massage and protects the bird from accidental injury,” one paper notes.) But this technique does not work on most large parrots. Around 2010, Lierz and his colleague Daniel Neumann developed a new method: inserting a small probe into the cloaca to deliver a weak electric current that stimulates a male bird to release sperm. “As kids we used to hold these 9-volt batteries to our tongues and it tingled, that’s roughly how you have to imagine this,” Lierz says. With artificial insemination, the researchers could finally pair birds according to their genetics. But the timing was crucial: Females usually lay two or three eggs and the moment one egg is laid is the right time to inseminate the next one. Purchase says he and Neumann spent hours watching female Spix’s macaws on video monitors. “As soon as we see the egg, we’re out and we go from aviary to aviary and we catch the male that we want, male No. 1 on the list. We try and collect semen from him, and if we don’t get enough … then we go to male No. 2,” Purchase says. In May 2013, the first artificially inseminated Spix’s macaw chicks hatched. More followed. “That’s what got us out of the genetic bottleneck,” Bouts says. The morning after Guth was fuming about the aviary delay, Purchase walked into a large room at the facility carrying a gray plastic cage in each hand. He set them down on the tiled floor, opened the door of one, reached inside with a dark towel, and enfolded what was inside. Kneeling on the floor, he delicately unwrapped the towel. A gray head emerged first, then turquoise feathers covering the parrot’s belly, and finally the rich blue of its back and tail. Purchase carried the bird over to Francois Le Grange, a veterinarian, who began to examine it—a final check before it would join the other candidates for release in the not-quite-finished outdoor aviary. The bird’s outraged “ca-á ca-á” echoed off the walls as Le Grange plucked a feather from beneath its wing. Then he listened to its heartbeat with a children’s stethoscope. He swabbed the mouth and the cloaca and finally drew some blood from a vein in the neck. The swabs would be tested for pathogens that might pose a risk to other animals after the birds are released. But the team is much more worried about the dangers these parrots themselves will face in the wild. After generations in captivity, their instincts for navigating and finding food have weakened, White says. There are predators, too, including opossums, snakes, and birds of prey. And, of course, humans—the species that drove the bird to extinction in the first place. Together these challenges doomed some earlier reintroduction programs. One of the highest profile examples was an attempt to bring the thick-billed parrot back to Arizona, Amato says. This brightly colored bird still lives in Mexico but has been hunted to extinction in the United States. Between 1986 and 1993, 88 of them (mostly confiscated birds originally trapped illegally in Mexico, but also some captive-bred birds) were released in the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona. Many were killed by hawks or cats or starved to death. After 2 months, only about two-thirds of the wild-caught birds survived. But the captive-bred birds did much worse, as a paper noted in 1994: “Almost all individuals have been lost within a few days of release as a result of substantial deficiencies in basic survival skills.” The program was abandoned in 1993, and the last time a thick-billed parrot was spotted in Arizona was in 1995. “The release program was a failure, even though a lot of money and effort was spent on it,” Amato says. “After that, many biologists felt that release programs for parrots generally were unlikely to be successful.” Yet Amato notes some hopeful counterexamples: the feral populations of escaped parrots that thrive in many parts of the world, including London and New York City. “These are like accidental reintroductions that worked,” he says. Some recent planned reintroductions have also had positive results, White says, including one he was involved in: the reintroduction of Puerto Rican parrots to El Yunque National Forest after they were wiped out by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Since 2020, 75 captive-reared animals have been released in the forest, which now hosts 34 birds. Four new nests were spotted this year, White says. “This was a true reintroduction and it has been very successful.” That night, as darkness descended over the caatinga, Lugarini headed out with a colleague to a creek near the facility. Wearing leather gaiters to protect against snakes, she followed the mostly dry creek bed, moving as quietly as possible. She stopped in front of a caraibeira tree, where a pair of Illiger’s macaws had made their nest. Illiger’s macaws, also known as bluewinged macaws, play an important role in the plan to bring back the Spix’s. Illiger’s are more common and inhabit a larger area than the Spix’s macaws, but in the caatinga the two birds’ lifestyles overlap. Both nest in hollows in caraibeira trees and feed on the same fruits and nuts. When the eight Spix’s are released, eight Illiger’s macaws taken from the wild will be released with them. The team hopes this mixed flock will join up with wild Illiger’s in the caatinga, allowing the Spix’s macaws to benefit from their knowledge of how to avoid predators, find food, and navigate. The team had already collected seven Illiger’s, and Lugarini had come for the eighth. Her headlamp casting a red glow, she grasped a cord looped around a branch high in the caraibeira tree, fixed a rope to it and then used the cord to pull the rope over the branch and back down. Looking up, she sighed with apprehension at the sight of bats circling the tree. “That’s worse than the snakes,” she said. Yet she slowly ascended the rope, the red light marking her progress. Ten meters up she reached the nesting hollow and looked inside. No birds. The Illiger’s macaws that had been nesting here were gone. One clear lesson from previous reintroductions is that releasing more animals is better. That’s because a bigger group can work together to spot dangers and find food. Finding a suitable mate is easier, too. For highly social species like macaws, numbers are especially important. “Let’s say you release 20 individuals and they all go 20 different directions, well then you haven’t reestablished a population,” White says. “They need to live in a group.” Combining captive Spix’s and wild Illiger’s thus solves two problems, White says. “We can actually increase the flock size without extra Spix’s … while using a native species which knows the habitat, knows the area, that can function as mentors.” Releasing birds of the right age can help keep them from scattering. Spix’s macaws start to reproduce around age 4 and then tend to return to the same nesting site year after year. “The sooner that those released macaws start reproducing, the sooner they become anchored to that site,” White says. “So you want to have birds that are entering or at reproductive age.” Providing supplementary food and nest boxes may also encourage the birds to remain close to the release site. When White and other researchers reviewed 47 releases of captive parrots into the wild, they found that the single biggest threat to success was predation. To reduce this risk, Purchase put metal bands around trees with nest hollows or nest boxes to keep predators like opossums from climbing the trees. To avoid tipping off would-be poachers, he put decoy bands around trees without nests, as well. The birds will also wear tracking collars. After a long day, Lugarini headed back to her hotel in Curaçá. As the four-wheel-drive vehicle bounced over the dusty road, goats scattered and closed wooden gates slowed her progress. It was a reminder that the Spix’s natural habitat barely exists anymore. A restoration project is ongoing but has been hampered by the lack of knowledge of this little-studied biome and by its location in one of the poorest regions of Brazil, where the goats that provide a lifeline for the local population have devoured much of the natural vegetation. “In the beginning I did sometimes think, ‘Why are we putting all this effort into bringing back one species that is extinct when there are so many other species that we could still save from extinction?’” Lugarini says. “But you have to remember that this flagship species helps us preserve and restore the caatinga, and that helps many other species, too.” Curaçá is home to about 30,000 inhabitants—and many homages to the Spix’s. Next to the gas station is the Spix hotel. The theater, restored with money from the Spix project, is bright blue. The city’s flag in front of the town hall includes a Spix’s macaw, though Lugarini notes “they got it wrong”: The bird has the yellow markings around the eyes and next to the beak that are typical of the Lear’s macaw, another threatened macaw that lives not far away. One resident, Fernando Ferreira, wrote the song about the lovesick Illiger’s macaw. Wearing shorts and a T-shirt, his gray hair swept back in a ponytail, Ferreira sat down with a guitar and sang another song he wrote about the Spix’s macaw, known here as ararinha azul, or little blue macaw: “My wish is to see you fly, my wish is to see you come back,” he sang. On the afternoon of 11 June, Ferreira will perform this song at a ceremony at the theater. There will be a video, speeches, and a press conference. Earlier that day, in front of a small group of people, Purchase will open the door of the aviary to release the birds. For those who have worked toward this for years, it will be a moment of joy and apprehension. “It will feel like a weight off my shoulders, probably,” Purchase says. But then comes the next weight—worrying about their survival. There is an element of guilt, Miyaki says, because humans drove the Spix’s to extinction. “We owe it to the species, for it to go back to the wild.” But the experience of 1995 still casts a shadow, she says. “The frustration after the first release of that female was so big,” she says. “I try to be optimistic, but I’m very anxious.” The project estimates that between one-third and two-thirds of the birds will be lost in the first year. If the losses are higher, the birds may be taken back in. “You try to make sure that you have covered all of the bases and thought about as many possible options and outcomes as possible,” White says. “But the day you release those birds, the day they leave that cage, a lot of things are no longer within your control.”",

          "title": "Unsung Heroes: Undercover wildlife officer to rescuer and anti-manjha activist, Rajesh Kumar dons many hats",
          "text": "A day in Rajesh Kumar’s life is filled with uncertainty, risk and some adventure. His closeness with nature and wildlife over the past decade has moulded him into an individual who wears multiple hats. The 33-year-old is a wildlife rescuer with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Forest Cell, a wildlife educator, an undercover wildlife officer and a naturalist who has been actively involved in rescue wildlife missions. Born in Bengaluru, Kumar’s interests gravitated towards nature and wildlife through literary works and research into the constitutional aspects of wildlife. He says, “The trigger point to venture into wildlife was when I started reading on the different wildlife acts enshrined in the Indian Constitution and found out they are still not being implemented in reality. I read up on scientific articles related to wildlife conservation which piqued my interest.” In 2010 he joined as a wildlife rescuer with the BBMP forest cell where he was tasked with rescuing reptiles, birds, trees and even insects in and around Bengaluru as well as across Karnataka. So far, Kumar has rescued and rehabilitated approximately 4,800 birds, 10,000 snakes and 2,000 mammals and domestic animals. Kumar has also worked as special officer and active volunteer for the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau under the Government of India where he operated under the shadows with the forest departments of different states in south India to monitor and report illegal wildlife trade. This includes illegal trade in tiger and leopard skins, ivory, blackbuck, trade of live birds and mammals, among others. His rescue missions were spread across places like Hassan, Chikmagalur, Shimoga, Bannerghatta (all in Karnataka), Wayanad (Kerala), Dharmapuri, Mettur and Krishnagiri (Tamil Nadu). Out of many illegal trade busts, Kumar feels that nabbing the traders who sold key chains with insects in Bengaluru’s market area is perhaps the one that meant the most to him. Although dealing with wildlife can be risky, Kumar believes that dealing with humans is riskier. “Over the years, I have personally faced death threats from poachers and illegal traders who were behind bars after I exposed their illegal activities. In some cases, I have also reported the threats to the police. In other cases, we educate the illegal traders about their wrongdoings and help them switch sides as informers,” adds Kumar who is also an animal caretaker under the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) of the central government. With many avian species in Bengaluru falling prey to manjha threads used for kite-flying, Kumar got his maiden mission around 2013 when the first such case involving manjha was reported in the city’s Ulsoor. “We had no clue as to how we can rescue birds from manjha because the case was new to us. But over time, after many cases were reported in the city, we figured it out and also began creating awareness about the threat that manjha poses to birds,” says Kumar, who rescued the most birds in 2016-17 – around 600. In fact, he had hogged the limelight during one of his toughest missions in 2012 when it took nearly 22 hours to rescue a kite from a manjha string in Bengaluru. His reports on the threat of manjha threads to birds were submitted to the Karnataka government and became instrumental in bringing a gazette notification banning manjha in the state in 2016. Kumar is also a certified naturalist under the Karnataka Eco-Tourism Board as part of which he has covered forests across the Western Ghats by foot to understand the ecological value of these ranges. His study on the flora and fauna there was also instrumental in conducting awareness campaigns for tribals and locals on environmental issues. The founder-trustee for Wild World Conservation Trust, which conducts nature-related activities, environment tours and campaigns for different sets of people, Kumar has been part of various programmes related to conservation, snakebite, waste management and removing nails from trees, among others. “Being a naturalist and a wildlife rescuer is filled with uncertainty and risk. I have compromised a lot on my personal life where I do not watch movies nor spend quality time with friends. In fact, receiving calls during unusual hours disturbs my health. Moreover, for rescuers like us there is hardly any safety gear, a comprehensive health insurance policy or an effective framework that addresses our problems. But I love to work on wildlife conservation due to my love of animals and birds which I would pass on to the next generation,” says Kumar who is also planning to set up a wildlife education centre in Bengaluru to educate people on urban wildlife.",

          "text": "On the evening of August 5, Comingson Dkhar got a tip-off on a call – someone was transporting wild animals in an SUV. The 33-year-old, who lives in Khliehriat in Meghalaya’s East Jaintia Hills, decided to investigate. He set out in a car to chase the truck down the winding roads of Khliehrat. Dkhar and his companions signalled to the vehicle to stop but it did not. “After about seven kilometres, we intercepted the vehicle near Jowai in West Jaintia Hills district,” said Dkhar, who is president of a civil society group called the Hynniewtrep National Youth Movement. In the truck were two men and six crates of wild animals. As they could not show any permits for the transportation of the animals, Dkhar informed the police. West Jaintia Hills superintendent of police Bikram D Marak said the vehicle was travelling from Mizoram and bound for Guwahati. The two men in it – driver Kormola Bru and passenger Michael Zosangliana – were residents of Mizoram. They were detained and handed over to forest officials after being booked under the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 for transporting animals without the permission of the chief wildlife warden or any other officer authorised by the state government. According to Marak, the animals included two hoolock gibbons, a Great Indian hornbill, two grey langurs, a Phayre’s leaf monkey and an otter. All these animals are listed under Schedule I and II of the Wildlife Protection Act, which means they cannot be hunted, sold, transported or traded. The animals recovered in the haul are found in parts of South and Southeast Asia. SM Sahai, Meghalaya’s chief conservator of forest (wildlife and biodiversity) surmised these particular specimens were not from India. “We can only guess that these animals entered India through Myanmar as the arrested people are from Mizoram which shares a porous border with Myanmar,” said Sahai. Four days later on August 9, West Jaintia Hills police intercepted another vehicle, bearing a Mizoram registration number, with seven hornbills on board. Marak said the birds had been smuggled as no legal documents were produced for their transportation. The driver was handed over to the Jowai wildlife division. These are not isolated incidents. Scroll.in spoke to the officials of major agencies – Indian Customs, state forest officials and police, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence – all of whom acknowledged a surge in wildlife trafficking from Myanmar into India through the North East borders. These incidents appear to have increased after the first Covid-19 lockdown, which started in March 2020. Data remains scarce but officials referred to frequent seizures by agencies in the last couple of years. Conservation activists say these animals often originate from private breeding farms in other South Asian countries. Officials and experts believe that the high demand for exotic pets, combined with major legal loopholes, has spurred this illegal trade of wild animals. Regulating the exotic The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, in its Smuggling in India Report 2019-2020, noted the increase “in smuggling of endangered and exotic fauna from different parts of the world into India”. Most of them end up as pets, the report said. India’s Wildlife Protection Act contains different schedules under which animals are listed. Various species are sorted according to the degree to which they are threatened and the level of protection accorded to them. But the legislation applies only to animals listed in the schedules of the act – with those under schedule I and II being strictly protected. Moreover, all species listed in the Act are native to India. What laws then apply to such animals which are often termed “exotic”? According to the government, exotic live species are animal or plant species moved from their original range, or location, to a new one. According to Debadityo Sinha, a lawyer who works with the Delhi-based think tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, the trade of such wild animals is regulated by the Customs Act, 1962, and the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992. “The forest department has a very limited role,” said Sinha. This has to do with an international agreement known as CITES – or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora. India has been party to it since 1976. It regulates the trade of wild animals to ensure that it does not harm any species deemed endangered. Like India’s Wildlife Protection Act, CITES has three appendices listing different species depending on the protection they require. Species listed in appendix I include animals that are in danger of extinction because of international trade. They require an import and export permit and cannot be used for commercial purposes. Appendix II species require only an export permit. Appendix III lists species that are protected in at least one country. Entries in this list are made when that country needs help regulating trade in the species. The conditions for trade vary, but such animals need a certificate of origin when traded from one country to another. According to Sinha, once such animals enter the country, it is difficult to take any legal action against the smugglers under the Wildlife (Protection) Act unless it can be proved that the animal was imported without meeting the CITES requirements. Consider the instance on May 25, when the Mizoram Police seized one of the largest hauls of 486 wild animals. The seizure took place at the Khankawn Police Checkgate in the state’s Champhai district, bordering Myanmar. According to the police, the haul included “exotic” tortoises, snakes, lizards and sloths as well as a wild cat and four pottos, a primate found in Western and Central Africa. Senior Mizoram forest official Pi Mawitei said the animals were not under the purview of the Wildlife Protection Act, and likely came from Myanmar. For instance, the potto falls under Appendix II of CITES but is not listed in any of the schedules of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. The police arrested five persons in the case but then handed them over to the customs department. The animals were also taken by the customs authorities as they were of foreign origin. They were later shifted to an Aizawl zoo for treatment and safe custody after a court order. Border routes According to Agni Mitra, deputy director of the Wildlife Control Bureau (Eastern Region), exotic species are smuggled into India from private breeding farms in Southeast Asian countries. The North East is “naturally and geographically” the route that is used. “That’s why we are recovering the animals in Mizoram, Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura,” he said. According to him, the animals are brought to India’s border states through Myanmar and sometimes Bangladesh. On May 9, forest officials and police made another seizure at the Khankawn police check post in Mizoram. This time, they seized exotic animals such as white cockatoos, kangaroo rats, a meerkat, and Burmese pythons, all smuggled in from Myanmar. Mizoram forest official Mawitei said the state is a key smuggling route as the border in Champhai district is porous. “It has been on the rise in recent days, making things difficult for us,” she said. Myanmar shares a 1,600-km-long border with the Indian states of Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. Mawitei said smugglers transport animals using undisclosed routes. “We are not in a position to track each and every incident,” she said. “The forest department is understaffed and our forest officials are not trained to deal with the exotic species.” Champhai Superintendent of Police Rex Zarzoliana Vanchhawng, too, said there had been a noticeable increase in the smuggling of exotic animals from Myanmar. “It does not end in Mizoram as it will further go [to] other parts of India,” he said. “The details of [the] network is not known because the arrested people are just the porters. They are not the main big players who are sitting somewhere else.” A Guwahati-based senior official of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, who did not wish to be identified, told Scroll.in that the smuggling route of exotic animals has shifted to Mizoram in the past one year and has become a major concern. The Manipur town of Moreh, bordering Myanmar, has traditionally been used as a transit route into India. It remains a smuggling hotspot, researchers and officials told Scroll.in. “But the source of all the major seizures in the last one year is linked to Mizoram,” said the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence official. According to the official, animal smuggling is carried out through an established and organised network. There is a chain of carriers who transport animals from Mizoram to Silchar in Assam. From there, another set of handlers takes the animals to Shillong and Guwahati before heading to other Indian cities. The handlers change from region to region making it difficult to trace the originating point of the animals – for example, one set of handlers transports the animals for 100km or so and then hands them over to the next. “The controlling of smuggling is a multi-agency role and smuggling is a very complex system,” said the official. “Our agency is trying our best to nab the smugglers,” A Gujarat-based researcher, who did not wish to be identified, said there were specialised smugglers for exotic animals. According to her, the route via Myanmar has been used to smuggle animals or animal parts out of India but lately it has become an entry point for exotic animals into India. “Usually, it has only been our animals – pangolin, rhino horns and others – going across the border,” she said. “It is very recent that animals from outside are coming.” It is unclear how much the recent surge in the North Eastern states has to do with the February 2021 coup in Myanmar. The World Wildlife Fund’s report on April 1 had highlighted a sharp increase of 74% in the online illegal wildlife trade in Myanmar and noted that the political crisis may have “exacerbated the trade”. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence official, however, denied that the situation in Myanmar had any effect on the trade. Jimmy Borah, senior manager, Legal and Advocacy Division of the non-profit Aaranyak, disagreed. According to him, it may have become easier to cross already porous international borders following the coup in Myanmar. Financial considerations are also at play. “People are in dire need of money and smuggling provides an easy way,” he said. A flawed amnesty scheme After the scare over zoonotic diseases raised by the pandemic, the government also seemed keen to close the legal loophole that allowed exotic animals to slip into the country unregulated. In June 2020, it issued an advisory aimed at regulating and documenting the presence of such species in India. The advisory noted that several citizens “have kept CITES… enlisted exotic animal species in their possession but there is no unified information system available of such stock of species at the State/Central level.” The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change sought a “voluntary disclosure” of such species and granted six months – until December 2020. It later extended the deadline to March 2021. Significantly, the advisory stated that owners of such species need not provide documentation if they declared the animals to the government before the deadline. An IndiaSpend report noted that by February 2021, 32,645 applications had been submitted to the government under the voluntary disclosure scheme. Borah, of the non-profit Aaranyak alleged that the voluntary disclosure clause may have allowed the owners of exotic species to declare animals which may have been acquired illegally. Agni Mitra also confirmed that the voluntary disclosure clause may have been exploited. Besides, Mitra said, a lot of people used the nine-month amnesty period to buy more animals and birds. In January and February 2021, at least 110 exotic animals were seized in two different incidents – one at Vairengte in Kolasib district on the Mizoram-Assam border and the other in Mizoram’s Champai district bordering Myanmar. A red-eared guenon, which is a primate species found in Africa, was among the animals found. Mitra pointed out that the Lok Sabha has passed the Wildlife Protection (Amendment) Bill, which has also prompted a rush to buy exotic animals. The amendment includes CITES species in a schedule of the Act. It will also allow for implementing CITES provisions to regulate trade in such species. “It will be legal to keep them, but with regulatory compliances, and sources need to be declared,” said Mitra. “So before the act comes into effect, people are trying to get exotic animals.” And a flawed law? While the amendment to the Wildlife (Protection) Act has not yet been cleared by Rajya Sabha, conservationists and experts have mixed opinions about the new bill. Sinha of the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy welcomed the bill saying it would also help regulate the domestic trade of such species. “It will give more teeth to the forest department,” Sinha said. However, Borah from Aaranyak said the amendment to Wildlife Protection Act would actually favour the trade of species as it would remove certain schedules and insert a new schedule for the species listed in the appendices of CITES. Borah pointed out that the bill allows the central government to form a management authority to grant permission for the export or import of specimens. Also, anyone in possession of a live specimen will have to get a registration certificate from the management authority – an officer not below the rank of an additional director general of forests according to the draft of the bill. “This might create a loophole as corruption can affect many such incidents,” said Borah. But finally, there is perhaps little the bill can do to stem the demand for exotic animals in India. As a customs official remarked, the growing number of seizures indicates that the demand for such animals continues unabated.",

          "title": "Lizard in your luggage? We're using artificial intelligence to detect wildlife trafficking",
          "text": "Blue-tongue lizards and sulphur-crested cockatoos are among the native animals frequently smuggled overseas. While the number of live animals seized by the Australian Government has tripled since 2017, the full scale of the problem eludes us as authorities don’t often know where and how wildlife is trafficked. Now, we can add a new technology to Australia’s arsenal against this cruel and inhumane industry. Our research, published today, shows the potential for new technology to detect illegal wildlife in luggage or mail. This technology uses artificial intelligence to recognise the shapes of animals when scanned at international frontlines such as airports and mail centres. Exotic species are also smuggled into the country, such as snakes, turtles and fish. This could disrupt Australia’s multi-billion dollar agricultural industries by introducing pests and diseases, and could also threaten fragile native ecosystems. An animal welfare problem Wildlife trafficking is driven by several factors, including purported medicinal purposes, animals having ornamental value or for the illegal pet trade. It can have fatal consequences, as it usually involves transporting individual animals in tight or cramped environments. This often results in the animals becoming stressed, dehydrated and dying. Some people have even tried to use chip packets to smuggle Australian wildlife. Read more: Conservation activists suing Indonesian zoo could inspire global action on endangered species trade Traffickers often transport several individuals in one go, in the hope one animal makes it alive. We don’t know the complete picture of which animals are being trafficked, how they’re trafficked or even when it’s occurring. But examples from seized cases in Australia suggest traffickers highly prize Aussie reptiles and birds. For example, shingleback lizards, a type of blue-tongue lizard, are considered one of Australia’s most trafficked species. Apart from being cruel and inhumane, wildlife trafficking can also facilitate the introduction of alien species into new environments. This brings significant biosecurity risks. For example, zoonosis (diseases jumping from a non-human animal to a human) involves people handling stressed, wild animals. Exotic species can also disrupt natural ecosystems, as we’ve famously seen with the damage wrought by cane toads in northern Australia. Unregulated wildlife entering the country may also harbour new diseases or destructive parasites. This could damage agricultural industries and potentially raise the prices of our fruit and vegetables. Read more: To lock out foot-and-mouth disease, Australia must help our neighbour countries bolster their biosecurity Creating an trafficking image library Our new research documents a variety of wildlife species, which have been scanned using state-of-the-art technology to help build computer algorithms using “Real Time Tomography”. Real Time Tomography is an imaging technique that uses a series of x-rays to scan an item (such as a lizard). It then produces a three dimensional image of the animal which, in turn, is used to develop algorithms. For example, mail and luggage can be scanned at the airport and, if wildlife are enclosed, the algorithms will alert operators of their presence. Our study scanned known species of trafficked Australian animals to create an image reference library. A total of 294 scans from 13 species of lizards, birds and fish were used to develop initial wildlife algorithms, with a detection rate of 82%, and a false alarm rate at just 1.6%. This research is the first to document the use of 3D X-ray CT security scan technology for wildlife protection within the peer-reviewed scientific literature. It’s also the first to report results for the detection of reptiles, birds and fish within such scans. The detection tool is designed to complement existing detection measures of Australian Border Force, biosecurity officers and detection dogs, which remain crucial in our fight against wildlife crime. How else are we stopping wildlife trafficking? The tools currently helping to detect and restrict wildlife trafficking mainly rely on human detection methods. This includes cyber-crime investigations or Australian Border Force and biosecurity officers manually searching bags. Biosecurity detector dogs patrolling airports are also useful, as are smartphone reporting apps such as the Wildlife Witness App. Also crucial are efforts to dismantle illegal trade networks at the source. This is by understanding and reducing consumer demand for wildlife and wildlife products, providing alternate livelihoods for would-be poachers, and enforcing stronger governance and monitoring. Seized animals can be used as evidence to identify traffickers, with previous cases resulting in successful prosecution by environmental investigators. For example, a former rugby league player has been jailed for four years after getting caught trying to smuggle a variety of animals in and out of Australia. Read more: Elephant ivory: DNA analysis offers clearest insight yet into illegal trafficking networks Continuing the fight All these measures help fight wildlife trafficking, but there’s no single solution to predict when and where the events will likely take place. Wildlife traffickers may adapt their behaviours frequently to avoid being detected. As a result, innovative and adaptive solutions, such as our new technology, are vital to support existing detection techniques. Any effort to stamp out this terrible activity is a step in the right direction, and the potential for 3D detection enables us to adapt and evolve with how traffickers may change their behaviours.

          "text": "The overall winner of the competition – The big buzz by Karine Aigner (Picture: Karine Aigner/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) Glimpses of the beauty and personality of the world’s animals and plants have been captured by the winners of the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year. Each year, the winning photos go on display at the Natural History Museum in London, and they rarely disappoint. Now, the winners of 2022’s contest, organised by the museum, have been announced. US photographer Karine Aigner won the overall prize for her image of a buzzing ball of cactus bees spinning over hot sand on a Texas ranch. All except one of the bees in the close-up are males, who are intent on mating with the single female at the centre. Like most bees, they are threatened by habitat loss, pesticides and climate change, as well as farming practices that disrupt their nesting grounds. The image was praised for its ‘sense of movement and intensity’ by the judges, with Ms Aigner the fifth woman in the competition’s 58-year history to claim the grand title award. Here are the other winners of the competition. ‘The beauty of baleen’ by Katanyou Wuttichaitanakorn, winner of the Young Wildlife Photography of the Year 15-17 years category, and the overall young title (Picture: Katanyou Wuttichaitanakorn/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) The other main title of Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year was won by 16-year-old Katanyou Wuttichaitanakorn, of Thailand. He was intrigued when a Bryde’s whale surfaced close to his boat, by the contrasting colours and textures of its dark skin, pink gum and the brush-like feeding mass that hung from its top jaw. The youngster, who has been a keen naturalist and a photographer since he was 12, managed to capture detail, including some tiny anchovies, in what the judges felt was a ‘dynamic composition’. Like other baleen whales, Bryde’s use a technique known as lunge-feeding to catch large numbers of small schooling fish and then filter the small prey from the ocean. Ms Cox said: ‘Out of the jaws of a Bryde’s whale comes this dazzling creation. ‘The pin-sharp detail of the tiny anchovies is set against an abstraction of colour with the weave of brown baleen hair rimmed by a cascade of water drops.’ House of bears by Dmitry Kokh, winner of the Urban Wildlife category (Picture: Dmitry Kokh/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) This photo already received attention outside of the competition for its unusual portrayal of polar bears outside of their usual snowy landscape. They are pictured here at an abandoned weather station on Kolyuchin Island in the Chukchi Sea – with bears now more likely to leave their usual habitats due to the changing climate. Russian photographer Dmitry Kokh managed to photograph earth’s largest land carnivores there, in images almost post apocalyptic. Out of the fog by Ismael Dominguez Gutierrez, winner of the Young Wildlife Photography of the Year 11-14 years category (Picture: Ismael Dominguez Gutierrez/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) The image of an osprey sitting on a dead tree as it waits for the fog to lift was caught by 14-year-old Ismael Dominguez Gutierrez, of Spain. The bat-snatcher by Fernando Constantino Martinez Belmar, winner of the Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles category (Picture: Fernando Constantino Martinez Belmar/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) Heavenly flamingos by Junji Takasago, winner of the Natural Artistry category (Picture: Junji Takasago/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) Puff perfect by Jose Juan Hernandez Martine, winner of the Animal Portraits category (Picture: Jose Juan Hernandez Martine/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) The courtship display of a Canary Islands houbara bird was caught in the light of the moon by Jose Juan Hernandez Martinez, of Spain. He dug himself a low hide and caught the bird’s puffed-out profile as it took a brief rest. Under Antarctic ice by Laurent Ballesta, winner of the Portfolio Award category (Picture: Laurent Ballesta/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) A theatre of birds’ by Mateusz Piesiak, winner of the Rising Star Portfolio Award category (Picture: Mateusz Piesiak/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) Shooting star by Tony Wu, winner of the Underwater category (Picture: Tony Wu/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) An image of the reproductive dance of a giant spawning sea star was taken by American/Japanese photographer Tony Wu and shows water filled with sperm and eggs. The ‘dancing’ shape of the spawning sea star as it rises and sways may help release eggs and sperm, or help sweep the eggs and sperm into the currents where they fertilise together in the water. New life for the tohora by Richard Robinson, winner of the Oceans: The Bigger Picture category (Picture: Richard Robinson/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) Battle stations by Ekaterina Bee, winner of the Young Wildlife Photography of the Year 10 Years and Under category (Picture: Ekaterina Bee/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) The Cuban connection by Karine Aigner, overall winner and winner of the Photojournalist Story Award category (Picture: Karine Aigner/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) Spectacled bear’s slim outlook by Daniel Mideros, winner Animals in their Environment category (Picture: Daniel Mideros/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) Spectacled bears, also known as Andean bears, are found from western Venezuela to Bolivia. But the bears have suffered massive declines as the result of habitat fragmentation. Daniel Mideros, of Ecuador, set up camera traps along a wildlife corridor used to reach high-altitude plateaus and was able to get this panoramic photo. The listening bird by Nick Kanaki, winner of the Behaviour: Birds category (Picture: Nick Kanaki/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) The dying lake by by Daniel Nunez, winner of the Wetlands – The Bigger Picture category (Picture: Daniel Nunez/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) Daniel Nunez, of Guatemala, used a drone to capture the contrast between a forest and the algal growth on Lake Amatitlan. He hopes the photograph will raise awareness of the impact of contamination on the lake which takes in about 75,000 tonnes of waste from Guatemala City every year. The great cliff chase by Anand Nambiar, winner of the Behaviour: Mammals category (Picture: Anand Nambiar/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) The magical morels by Agorastos Papatsani, winner of the Plants and Fungi category (Picture: Agorastos Papatsani/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) Ndakasi’s passing by Brent Stirton, winner of the Photojournalism category (Picture: Brent Stirton/Wildlife Photographer of the Year/PA) The two grand title awards were picked from the winners of 19 categories which highlighted the natural world in all its wonder and diversity. They were among 38,575 entries from 93 countries which were judged on their originality, narrative, technical excellence and ethical practice. An exhibition of the top images submitted to the competition opens at the Natural History Museum in London on October 14, before going on a UK and international tour. Dr Doug Gurr, director of the Natural History Museum said: ‘Wildlife photographers offer us unforgettable glimpses into the lives of wild species, sharing unseen details, fascinating behaviours and frontline reporting on the climate and biodiversity crises. ‘These images demonstrate their awe of and appreciation for the natural world and the urgent need to take action to protect it.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

          "title": "The steady decline of Ladakh’s nomadic herders",
          "text": "On December 18, 2020, RK Mathur, the lieutenant governor of the union territory of Ladakh, chaired the first-ever meeting of the State Board for Wildlife Ladakh. Under the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2002, every state and union territory has to constitute such a board, whose key responsibilities include advising the local government in the “selection and management of the areas to be declared as protected areas”. At the meeting, the board ordered the rationalisation of two vast wildlife sanctuaries in Ladakh – Changthang Cold Desert Wildlife Sanctuary and Karakoram Wildlife Sanctuary. In simple terms, rationalisation refers to the delineation of boundaries of a designated area. In a protected area, like a wildlife sanctuary, it also involves categorisation of key areas within the delineated boundaries. This is crucial to planning different conservation management efforts within the area. The board recorded two broad reasons for this order. First, as population had grown, the use of land had changed, as had the likely further needs for development – this made it imperative to precisely mark out protected territories. Second, that there was an increased requirement of land for defence infrastructure in the region. Of the two sanctuaries, it was Changthang where both these problems were particularly pressing. In the past five years, the region has seen significant conflicts between locals and the administration over the use of land, as well as heightened military tensions with China. The board assigned the task of rationalisation to the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, an autonomous scientific advisory institute under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. An interim report that the institute submitted in December 2021 to the Ladakh government’s forest department noted that there were vast discrepancies between the official records on Changthang, and reality on the ground. Specifically, while the official notification of Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary, from 1987, mentioned that the protected area covered a region of 4,000 square kilometres, the map and the description of the sanctuary in the notification indicated that the sanctuary area accounted for around 13,000 square kilometres. These discrepancies were not unknown earlier, but this was the first time they were documented in detail. “The notification had serious errors and was very ambiguous in terms of the sanctuary’s boundaries,” said Yash Veer Bhatnagar, a scientist with Nature Conservation Foundation, a Mysuru-based non-government wildlife research and conservation organisation, and also a member of the State Board for Wildlife Ladakh. The report noted that “much of the area” that technically fell within the sanctuary needed to be excluded from it “due to population growth and land use changes”. It added, “Similarly, as per national needs and army presence, much of the area needs to be rationalized from the notified sanctuary area.” Many locals Scroll.in spoke to welcomed the process of rationalisation. In Ladakh, the tourism industry has mushroomed over the last decade. In 2014, Leh, its most popular destination among tourists, saw 1.80 lakh visitors; by 2018, this number had nearly doubled, to 3.27 lakh visitors. After a dip for two years due to Covid-19, Leh saw a windfall in tourist numbers, with around 2.5 lakh tourists visiting in just June and July this year. But confusion about the boundaries of protected areas has long been a source of conflict between locals, known as Changpas, and the government. In April 2019, for instance, the administration demolished several structures locals had built for tourism services in Spangmik village in the Pangong area. In response, locals protested by marching towards the China border, as a symbol of rejection of the administration’s authority – they were stopped by the Indian army, close to the border. This was just one incident in a long history that residents of the region believed indicated the administration’s bias against them – some told Scroll.in that in the 2019 incident, other constructions in the same area were left untouched. “They allow construction by the tourism department and the army, but not locals,” rued 48-year-old Namgial Ombuchan, a pastoral nomad from eastern Ladakh’s Chushul village. “At the time of demolition, the authorities didn’t demolish their own huts or those of the army, but only those of the ordinary locals.” Rationalisation, many believed, would help resolve such conflicts. “I feel rationalisation will help Changpas have alternative economic opportunities,” explained Tsering Angchok from Phobrang, India’s last village on the eastern Ladakh border. “It will be easier to do constructions and make some investment in tourism sector.” Less clear is the effect that this change will have on those of the community who continue to practice the traditional occupation of herding – wool from goats they rear have been the primary source of raw material for Ladakh’s famed pashmina industry, which was worth 100 crore in 2021. A range of government measures has ensured that the pashmina industry has remained stable over the years. These include programmes by the textile ministry targeted at promoting the production and sale of pashmina, as well at improving the living standards of the nomads who rear pashmina goats. But India’s share of global production is only 1% – the trade is dominated by China, which supplies around 75% of the fabric to the world. India’s position is likely to be further challenged as, for a variety of reasons, herding declines as an occupation among the community. These include pressures from the army, new and more stable avenues of employment, as well as changing vegetation patterns as a result of climate change. For now, only those of an older generation, who have a close bond with the land, remain in the profession. “I will do this work as long as I am alive,” said 48-year-old Ombuchan, who owns 250 sheep and goats. “I have three children, and all of them go to school far off from here. They don’t want to do this work.” Even if they did return to the region, he added, “they won’t be walking behind sheep and goats, because it entails a lot of hard work. They might do something related to tourism or find a job to make easy money.” This story is part of Common Ground, our in-depth and investigative reporting project.

The Changthang region is a high-altitude cold desert with an average altitude of 4,500 metres above sea level, comprising an area of 22,000 square kilometres. With a population of a little more than 13,000, according to the 2011 census, it is India’s most sparsely populated region. Bird Migration across the Himalayas, an edited volume by Herbert HT Prins and Tsewang Namgail, defines the landscape of Changthang as one “marked by high-altitude steppe, brackish lakes, wetlands and mountains” and its climate as being “characterized by extreme cold, strong winds, relative aridity and high radiation.” According to the Wildlife Institute of India’s interim report on rationalisation, the region is dotted with many high-altitude lakes, out of which 13 are major lakes and 10 are marshes along major rivers. It is also a habitat for a spectrum of animal species, including endangered snow leopards, great Tibetan sheep, yaks, Tibetan wild ass, black-necked cranes and Tibetan gazelles. In 1989, in recognition of their distinctive lifestyle and occupation, the Changpa community, who inhabit the region, were given the status of a Scheduled Tribe by the Jammu and Kashmir government. While many of these pastoralists are of Indian origin, a significant number of them trace their origin to Tibetans who migrated towards India during the late 1950s and subsequent years. The 1987 notification of a section of the Changthang landscape as a wildlife sanctuary observed that the area had “adequate ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological significance for purposes of protecting, propagating and developing wildlife or its environment.” But while the notification stated that 4,000 square km was to be protected, and maps issued with the notification indicated that 13,000 square km was protected, Bhatnagar explained that on the ground, the government essentially treated the entire 22,000 square km as protected area. This, he said, was detrimental in every way: from the perspective of the locals, for the defence establishment, and for wildlife conservation. “The thing is, if you are considering the entire Changthang region as a sanctuary then effectively everything and anything the defence forces do there, is illegal,” he said. “Similarly, anything and everything that is done by the government in terms of the welfare of people, like installing water supply or making roads, is illegal.” Meanwhile, from the conservation perspective, it was simply too sprawling an area to administer as a protected territory, he explained. Rather, what was needed was to identify core areas, for which conservation objectives could be set and pursued. The conflicts within the protected area only intensified after the state of Jammu and Kashmir was divided and downgraded in 2019 by the Central government into two union territories: one bearing the name of the former state, and the other, Ladakh. When Ladakh was a part of the Jammu and Kashmir state, “there weren’t many restrictions or objections from the wildlife department. That’s why so many constructions, even though temporary, have taken place on the banks of Pangong lake over the years,” explained Tashi Namgyal Yakzee, executive councilor of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Leh. The council is one of two autonomous governance bodies in the union territory whose members are elected through direct vote by the public. (The other is the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Kargil.) “After we became a union territory, it became a serious issue,” said Yakzee, who holds the portfolio of animal and sheep husbandry and wildlife in the council. He added that the lieutenant governor “was forced to act. Then the wildlife board was constituted and a decision of rationalisation was taken.” According to Yakzee, rationalisation will pave the way for key development works in the Changthang region. This work is expected to be boosted by a Rs 245 crore development package for the Changthang region, which the lieutenant governor announced in August 2020. Under the package, the government aims to develop critical infrastructure, including for housing, health and education, and avenues of employment in the region. Tailored according to the region’s pastoralist economy, “most” of the package’s funds are to be utilised in the construction of insulated houses for the Changpa nomads in the region, according to a government release. Two museums that showcase the Changpa community’s lifestyle and culture are also coming up in the region under the plan. But progress on all these fronts is slowed down by the fact that the rationalisation is yet to be completed. Yakzee explained that the ambiguity about the boundaries of Changthang wildlife sanctuary was acting as a hurdle, since wildlife laws prohibited infrastructural work in the area. “Once the rationalisation is done, the scope for these impediments doesn’t arise,” he said. “We are all waiting for its completion.” Rationalisation is also expected to expedite defence-related infrastructure projects in the region, according to a senior government official in the Ladakh administration. In the aftermath of border tensions in 2020 along the Line of Actual Control, the board had cleared many proposals for establishing army outposts and laying down roads in the region. Work on many of these projects is still ongoing. For now, all the defence-related projects within the wildlife sanctuary region are assessed and cleared by the National Board of Wildlife. Once certain areas are identified as lying outside protected areas, the official explained, the army will not require the board’s clearance for work in them. While many welcome the process of rationalisation, and the accompanying development, some anticipate that it will likely intensify the multiple pressures that herders have been facing in recent years. These include pressures from the army: nomads across eastern Ladakh complain that in the aftermath of border clashes with China in 2020, the army began denying access to pastures for their livestock due to the lands’ proximity to the Chinese border. Tensions with China had increased that year to a level not seen since the 1962 Sino-Indian war. They peaked in June, after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in clashes with Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley. Among the areas to which herders found their access restricted was Gurung Hill, near eastern Ladakh’s Chushul area. During the 2020 border standoff between India and China, the hill, located south of Pangong lake, became one of the places where Indian army forces mobilised to preempt any intrusion by Chinese soldiers. For the nomads of Chushul, the army’s deployment on the hill deprived them of a key winter pasture for their livestock. “Earlier, we used to cross the hill and graze our livestock on its foothills on the other side,” explained Namgial Ombuchan, the nomad from Chushul, who had been visiting the hill to graze his livestock for decades. “But now the army is not even allowing us to come near the hill. They wave red flags and chase us away.” At the same time, the army – along with those who set up tourism enterprises – also indirectly contributes to the traditional pastoralism because it offers locals relatively stable employment. Seventy-year-old Tsering Angchuk explained that many locals had chosen “to work on a decent monthly salary as labourers with the army or BRO”, the Border Roads Organisation. Others, he said, had “invested in tourism business like camping sites and cottages”. In contrast, he added, “Rearing livestock is a difficult job and there are no holidays or rest.” Angchuk lives in Phobrang, India’s last village on its eastern border with China. He is a retired paramilitary personnel who has also in the past served as the village’s sarpanch, and as an elected executive councilor of Leh’s autonomous council. Until last year, he had a flock of around 90 sheep and goats. In summers, Angchuk would send his livestock with other nomads of the village to pastures for grazing. “I would pay for them in the form of barley and fodder that I grow on my farm,” he explained. In winters, he liked to take care of the animals at his home or some nearby winter pastures in the village. However, this winter, he was simply unable to tend to his animals because of his advanced age. Angchuk has four sons and three daughters. None of them are ready to take up their father’s work. All of them work with different arms of the government, far from their home. “It isn’t possible for a 70-year-old man to take care of livestock,” he said. “Therefore, I sold them.” Angchuk’s decision has become a norm in Phobrang. “Ten years ago, 99% of this village was nomadic and everyone had goats and sheep,” explained Angchuk. Today, out of a total of 110 families in the village, only 14 have members who are nomadic pastoralists. All of them belong to the older generation of Changpas, whose children have either shifted to Leh in search of work or better education. Nowhere is this phenomenon more visible than in eastern Ladakh, in villages like Man, Merak, Spangmik and Lukung, situated on the banks of the famous Pangong lake. Not so long ago, locals recount, all the villagers engaged in livestock rearing and barley farming to earn their livelihood. But within the last two decades or so, the region has transformed into a tourist hub, and almost every household has converted its house into a homestay or cafe for tourists. “All of us are Changpas culturally, but with a new source of livelihood,” said Chewang Rigzin, a practitioner of Tibetan medicine in Merak. Apart from these economic pressures, some experts believe that climate change is also likely to have a negative impact on the occupation of livestock rearing. A study published in August by Nature Climate Change journal, projected that the Tibetan Plateau, of which Ladakh is a part, also known as the “water tower” of Asia could lose significant water storage capacity by 2050 due to climate change. The freshwater systems on the plateau supply water to nearly 2 billion people. In the Indus basin, the river system which originates on the plateau, and which supplies water to India and Pakistan, the water-supply capacity is expected to decline by 79%. “Water scarcity is a big issue in Changthang,” noted Dr Kunzes Angmo, of Leh’s High Mountain Arid Agriculture Research Institute, or HMARI, who has worked as a researcher in Changthang. “Older people say there used to be a lot of snowfall in the past. Now it’s not happening. Besides, the precipitation is not happening at the right time.” Alongside this change, she noted, the region’s vegetation was changing. “Earlier, there were more palatable grasses for the livestock,” she said. She also noted that a plant known as Cirsium, or creeping thistle, “is increasingly growing in Changthang. It’s a weed with thorns and is not palatable. During my recent observation in the region, I saw it everywhere. This is something which can be problematic in future.” Studies attest to Angmo’s observations about shifts in vegetation patterns. In April 2020, a study published in the journal ‘Food and Scientific Reports’ pointed out that Ladakh’s native species of vegetation are under pressure from weeds like Cirsium. The study warned of the plant eventually driving out nomads from the region. “These weeds are now fast occupying the pastures and reducing the palatable plants or grass species in eastern Ladakh-Changthang of cold and arid regions,” it noted, “and therefore compelling livestock to migrate in other parts of the region in search of forages.” Residents have also observed shifts in climate and vegetation over the years. In perhaps the most catastrophic example, in early 2013, the region witnessed its worst snowfall in nearly 50 years, resulting in the death of over 18,000 Pashmina goats due to harsh weather and lack of fodder. “The climate is upside down. We are witnessing a lot of heat in winters and biting cold in summers,” said Guru Tsering, a 51-year-old nomad from Chumathang, who, in mid August, was camping with three other nomad families of his village in the pastures near the panoramic Yaya Lake. Tsering added that there are some years when herders struggled to find grass “Last year, there was bad grass and our livestock had a really difficult time finding fodder,” he said. There had been “relatively better” grass this year, added Tsering. Tsering, like many nomads in Changthang region, is on the verge of giving up livestock rearing. His four children study in Leh city. His knees give him trouble, as a result of which he has put on weight and is unable to move like he used to. “I think I will be able to do this work for the next four-five years only,” he said. “After that I will look for work in the army or GREF,” the General Reserve Engineer Force. Tsering owns 350 sheep and goats, but doesn’t own any land. His is one among the four families in Chumathang who still rear livestock. “There are a total 16 families in Chumathang who had been working as Changpas for nearly 150 years,” Tsering pointed out. “Now, it’s only four of us, and we don’t know till how long we will continue to do this.” The shifts in the lives of Changpas is also likely to affect Kashmir’s handicrafts industry – most nomadic herders derive their livelihood by producing world-famous pashmina or cashmere wool sourced from Changra goats reared in the region. Official estimates suggest that around 2,500 Changpa families currently engage in pashmina production. But according to those in the region, this number is dropping steadily, although as of now no official estimates are available of this shift. “We are witnessing nomads selling their livestock and shifting to Leh for better opportunities, in front of our eyes,” said Thinles Nurboo, general secretary of Leh’s All Changthang Pashmina Growers Cooperative Marketing Society, a federation of 22 cooperatives who procure pashmina from growers and market it outside Ladakh. For now, the decline in number of livestock itself has not been dramatic. According to an estimate by Leh district’s sheep husbandry department, there are currently around 2 lakh sheep and goats in the Changthang region. Around ten years back, this number stood at 2.3 lakh. “There is some decline in the number of households who have left livestock rearing as an occupation. But the number of livestock is not declining to a great degree,” underlined Dr Tundup Namgyal, Leh district’s sheep husbandry officer. But in the absence of a steady rise in livestock numbers, the production of pashmina in recent years has also not shown significant growth. In 2014, the production stood at 45 metric tonnes; this rose to nearly 50 tonnes in 2016. But in 2021, the production stood at 45 metric tonnes again, according to Leh’s sheep husbandry department. According to Namgyal, for now, the department’s efforts to control diseases and improve yield from animals has ensured that the total production of pashmina fabric has not dipped. “The average productivity per animal has gone up,” he said. “Earlier, it used to be around 190 grams per animal which has gone up to 250 grams per animal. At present, the situation is more or less stable.” In fact, procurement by the All Changthang Pashmina Growers Cooperative Marketing Society also remains high: every year, the cooperative procures between 60%and 70% of the total 45 tonnes of pashmina produced in Ladakh. The rest of the produce is procured by entrepreneurs and dealers directly from the nomads. “In 2020-’21, we procured 11 tonnes of Pashmina. The next year, the procurement rose to 17 tonnes,” explained Thinles Nurboo. But Nurboo cautioned that this increase was at odds with the decline he had observed in the overall number of growers in the business. He believes that the rise in the cooperative’s procurement could simply be because more growers sold their pashmina to the cooperative in 2021-’22, as opposed to selling to other buyers the previous year. According to Nurboo, the real picture of the pashmina industry might emerge only gradually, owing to a lack of data about the growers and their selling patterns. “We are issuing grower cards and data is being compiled,” he said. “We’ll get an idea about how much pashmina is there and how many growers are there. We can also track the growers and where they are selling.” Nurboo added that despite the challenges it faced, the pashmina sector remained lucrative and held the potential to allow Changthang’s nomads to retain their traditional identity and lifestyle. “Ladakhi pashmina is a brand and has a huge potential in the international as well as local market,” Nurboo said. But in order to tap this potential, he explained, growers would need to be given greater incentives to remain in the business. Currently, pashmina is purchased in raw form from nomads, and rises sharply in value as it is put through processes such as cleaning and dehairing. “There’s a huge difference in what a grower gets for his produce and the final products made from the fine quality fabric,” he said. According to a pashmina dealer in Kashmir, who asked to remain anonymous, raw pashmina, sourced from Changpas, is typically procured for between Rs 3,000 and Rs 4,000 per kilogram. After dehairing and cleaning, the material is turned into wool, which sells at between Rs 18,000 and Rs 20,000 per kilogram. A kilogram of raw pashmina yields around 250 grams of wool. This wool – either through machinery or manual work – is turned into a similar quantity of yarn, which is used to weave shawls, stoles and other fabrics. A shawl, which typically needs 200 grams of pashmina yarn, sells for between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000 – an increase of more than 1,000% from the raw pashmina. Nurboo suggested that the government needed to introduce a policy “where the nomads themselves process the fabric at their own level and then sell it to the outside market. It will automatically add value to their produce and many might find the trade profitable enough to not give it up,” he said. Ladakh’s infrastructure to process pashmina is also limited. Dr Tundup Namgyal of the Leh’s sheep husbandry department explained that the existing Pashmina dehairing plant in Leh can only process a limited amount of the raw wool. “We are establishing another advanced dehairing plant in Leh and the work is on. It will be completed soon,” he said. Some initiatives are underway to help boost Ladakh’s pashmina industry. Among them is Looms of Ladakh, cooperative of local women of the Changthang region, who process pashmina themselves, and design products for the market. The initative was set up in 2017 by Prasanna Ramaswamy G, a serving Indian Administrative Officer in Leh, and his wife, Abhilasha. It can now absorb 200 local women as employees, and thus serves as a significant example of how the industry can be boosted with innovative ideas of localised entrepreneurship. Nurboo noted that the All Changthang Pashmina Growers Cooperative Marketing Society, besides procuring pashmina from growers at a minimum support price, also promotes local entrepreneurship around pashmina. “We work with various student organisations and provide career counseling to them, related to the intricacies and opportunities in the pashmina trade,” said Nurboo. However, Nurboo conceded that there were gaps in government policy on pashmina. “The new pashmina dehairing plant has been built in Leh, which is far for the people of Changthang. It should have come up in Changthang itself and local people should be trained and employed to run it.” Dr Kunzes Angmo, the researcher at Leh’s High Mountain Arid Agriculture Research Institute, feels the protection of the traditional livelihood of Changpas will need interventions at the grassroots level as well. “The problem in Changthang is very basic,” she said. “There are no basic facilities like electricity, communication, educational and health institutions. If we are able to provide them all these facilities within their native setting and at the same time add value to their work, many of them will go back to their older, sustainable ways of livelihood.”",

          "title": "Silent Forests: Post-pandemic wildlife consumption threatens human and forest health",
          "text": "Editor’s Note: This article is one of two stories that delves into how Southeast Asia’s wildlife consumption affects human and forest health, with implications for biodiversity and future pandemics. They were brought into the wildlife rescue centre not in cages, but in fine-mesh bags, as though already fresh meat waiting to be sold by the gram. But the four ferret badgers were kicking and hissing as staff from Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, a conservation group, worked to free them. Local police seized the animals from a restaurant and took them to the group’s facility in Cuc Phuong National Park, about a two-hour drive from Hanoi and the oldest national park in the country. “The restaurant bought them from people who caught them from the forest,” said Tran Van Truong, the captive coordinator in charge of the centre. “They are a bit stressed out now, but they seem okay otherwise. We can probably release them back into the wild after a few days.” Trapping wild animals for bushmeat is illegal in Vietnam, though the practice is still widespread. In other parts of Southeast Asia, Covid-19 and its probable origins in the wildlife trade has had little impact on the region’s snaring crisis. In the wake of the pandemic, wild animals are still being hunted to be eaten or kept as pets. Based on Southeast Asia Globe and The Straits Times’ observations in more than 30 interviews with conservationists, scientists, rangers and government officials, Southeast Asia’s forests are emptying of wildlife faster than they can replenish. And it’s inching towards local extinctions across the region. In Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City, monkeys, snakes, boars and birds are sold at various markets. Wild porcupine and deer are found on restaurant menus in the country’s Central Highlands, and so are wild birds. In northern Cambodia, the extent of the snaring problem is tied directly to how the traps are becoming easier and cheaper to set. This is causing the forests of Preah Vihear province to be emptied out so quickly that protected areas, like Phnom Tnout Wildlife Sanctuary, once rowdy with the cackle of hornbills and the howls of gibbons, have become eerily silent. Subsistence hunting is an age-old tradition, especially in regions where communities rely on natural resources. Growing up in a village near the forest in Vietnam’s Ninh Binh province, Tran recalled how his neighbours hunted wild animals for food.“When locals hunt for themselves, only a limited number of animals are taken from the forest,” Tran said. “But when commercial reasons come in, when people want to earn money by selling the animals to other cities or countries, they take more animals to sell to others.”Stripping forests of wildlife can have profound impacts on delicate ecosystems that have been forming over millennia. And this depletion of wildlife negatively affects humans as well, experts say. Tran recalled one particular rescue that illustrates the scale of the problem.After joining Save Vietnam’s Wildlife in 2017, he went on a rescue mission to save more than 100 pangolins, which are hunted for their scales to be used in traditional medicine in China and throughout Asia.It is still the largest rescue of its kind to date, Tran said, adding that the size of the rescue indicates the true scale of the problem.“When animals are hunted in such large numbers, it makes the forest go silent,” he said. A 2014 report by the Centre for International Forestry Research also noted that commercial poaching which supplies regional markets and beyond with bushmeat and traditional medicinal products, has endangered wildlife, especially mammals, which have reduced densities of wildlife in many Southeast Asian countries. Experts have warned that the continued trade in wild animals, endangered or not, increases the risk of diseases jumping from animals to humans. And tropical forests depleted of seed-dispersers, such as birds and monkeys, could mean fewer trees, making these carbon-storing habitats less of an ally in humanity’s struggle to tackle climate change. Recipe for a pandemic Wearing gloves and a surgical mask, Save Vietnam’s Wildlife veterinarian Tran Nam Trieu examined a group of ferret badgers to ensure they had no other injuries. The wild animals that come through the centre’s gates are often wounded, even missing limbs, mostly from poachers’ traps. The bodies of the four ferret badgers bore no obvious wounds, though Tran said the hissing and growling indicated a high level of stress. Once the animals calm down, they will be examined more thoroughly Tran Nam Tran said. But for the next 30 days, the ferret badgers will be placed in quarantine, each in their own holding cell, to ensure that any diseases they may have are not spread to the other animals in the facility. Besides the quarantine policy, the facility implements multiple biosecurity measures to reduce the potential spread of diseases among wildlife, and between the animals and humans. Buckets of disinfectant were spread throughout the facility. Before entering the building, visitors must wear boots in specific parts of the facility, such as the wildlife quarantine area. But the health practices at the rescue centre could not be more different to how wild animals are handled elsewhere in the region. At the wet markets in Ho Chi Minh City where wildlife is sold, many animals were packed into small cages — with some wild birds seen trampling carcasses left in the crate — and the sellers often handled them with no protective equipment.“Wildlife markets are an ideal landscape for zoonotic disease transmission because they have a combination of diverse wildlife species, housed in high densities, in poor biosafety conditions,” said Debby Ng, a wildlife disease ecologist at the National University of Singapore’s Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. “Motivations for hunting and wildlife trade can be diverse even within countries. It is important to learn these motivations and provide feasible alternatives that can address the needs of the people involved in the trade.” At farms in Buon Ma Thuot, Vietnam’s coffee capital in the Central Highlands, porcupines are reared for their meat, and civets, for coffee production. ‘Cong ca phe’, or coffee made with beans found in the droppings of civets, is expensive in many parts of the world despite its intestinal origins. The farm involved in rearing porcupines and civets sold a kilogram of cong ca phe for $165, or 4 million Vietnamese dong, compared to a $12 for a bag of regular coffee. The owner of the farms said he purchased his civets from a seller elsewhere, but that the animals had been reared in captivity and were not from the forests. His porcupines were also mostly farmed, with the exception of the original pair that had been caught from the wild. He declined to show his civet enclosure, though there were approximately 50 porcupines in his possession, held in concrete cells placed in a shed with little ventilation.A young civet, apparently rejected by its mother at birth, was suspended in a cage over the porcupines. Its tail was bloodied and appeared to have been bitten. The farmer said he was unafraid of contracting diseases from the animals, though claimed that “If any of them had Covid-19, I would be willing to cull them all.” A looming threat Emptying forests for human consumption – whether for subsistence or sale – increases wildlife interactions with people and domestic animals. As Southeast Asia recovers from Covid-19, this ever-present and growing interface poses potential threats of a new pandemic. The Institute of Food Technologists, a scientific society working on food science, reported in 2020 that wild animals are usually exposed to parasites, viruses, and other hazards not found in farmed meats as their environments are less controlled than farmed animals. William Chen, a professor and director of the Nanyang Technological University’s Food Science and Technology Programme, said animals usually bred for consumption are kept in farms with strict hygiene standards and veterinary services. These types of farms ensure their animals are vaccinated and have adequate nutrition. Biosecurity measures and animal welfare standards also tend to be more established for regularly farmed animals. “With good inspection measures in place, zoonotic spillover in farms should be low, although a small risk still remains,” said Chen, who is also an advisor to the World Health Organisation. Ng, said it is not just the direct consumption of wildlife that could spark pathogen transmission between animals and humans. Other human activities, such as the clearance of wildlife habitats, could also increase the interface between animals and humans. “Rapid urbanisation and subsequent environmental contamination from the influx of people, industry, and infrastructure directly impact how wildlife moves and survives,” Ng said. This issue is not unique to Southeast Asia. Forests across Asia-Pacific are also falling silent, according to Ng. Ng gave the example of the Himalayan Mutt Project, which in 2014 aimed to vaccinate and neuter free-roaming domestic dogs in Nepal that were attacking endangered animals, such as the red panda, and threatening the public with diseases, such as rabies and distemper. Roads opened up farming potential in wildlife habitat. Domestic dogs, which came with humans, roamed the area freely, coming into contact with both wild animals and people, exposing both to diseases.Not only do silent forests affect biodiversity, but concerns are growing over what they may mean for human health. Pablo Sinovas, the country director for Fauna & Flora International in Cambodia, said the conservation group recently joined a new European Union-funded research project to study those concerns. “The aim of the project is to understand how biodiversity loss is linked to the spread of zoonotic diseases. So we can perhaps prevent the emergence of future pandemics, while at the same time improve conservation of biodiversity,” Sinovas said. “In a post-pandemic and climate changing world, this has become a more pressing issue than ever.” The four-year project, Biodiversity Conservation to Mitigate the Risk of Emerging Infectious Diseases, or BCOMING, will involve multiple regions, including Southeast Asia, West Africa and the Caribbean, which are hotspots for potential emerging pathogens. “​​It’s important to have a more collaborative regional approach in preparing for the next pandemic,” said Veasna Duong, head of the virology unit at Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, which is also part of the project. “This project focuses on how biodiversity conservation can reduce spillover events.”The study focuses on Cambodia since viruses related to Sars-CoV-2 – the pathogen that causes Covid-19 – have been found in bat populations in the Kingdom. Bat samplings will take place across Cambodia. The study will also have a sociological element in which researchers will look at how policy could impact human and wildlife interactions. Building on past research into the presence of diseases in wildlife markets and bushmeat supply chains, Duong hopes BCOMING will help Cambodia understand how virus genomes evolve and what the tell-tale signs are of potential spill over to humans. Emptying forests and carbon losses Two enormous skulls casually collected dust at the back of a shed in BeTreed Adventures, an eco-tourism lodge in Cambodia’s Preah Vihear Province. The prized horns had not been torn off and sold like so many others. The skulls were from two banteng — a cattle species poached to the brink of extinction for its meat and horns — that had died after they were caught in snares set by poachers in the protected area.“They’ve been setting snares since I first came, but they’ve been getting more advanced,” said Ben Davis, co-founder of BeTreed Adventures, during an anti-snare patrol. He’s been working on wildlife protection for years, setting up the organisation in 2012, an ecotourism lodge located within the Phnom Tnout Wildlife Sanctuary. Davis, who has been living in Cambodia since 1992, said snaring isn’t new to the Kingdom. In the past, it would take a group of men a day just to set up one trap, Davis explained. Animals walking into such traps were often instantly killed by a falling tree or log. “Snaring was an issue then, but it wasn’t that big of a problem,” Davis said. But in the last 20 years, the affordability of brake wire and twine used for snares has made it easier for the traps to be deployed. Cutting through hanging vines and wading past long grass, Davis and his team of rangers found over 10 snares made of twine and twig within 100 metres from the first trap they discovered. “There are more people setting snares, and they’re much cheaper snares, so they set much more. Instead of one person setting five or 10 traps like they used to do for subsistence, each one sets literally hundreds,” said Davis, who is in the process of digging a 32-kilometre trench in a “last-ditch effort” to stave off local extinctions. . Large animals such as the banteng, as well as monkeys and large birds like hornbills, are highly prized by hunters as they yield more meat for sale. A 2019 study noted that large animals are primary targets for hunting, particularly in areas with good transport connections to major towns where wild meat can be sold. Yet these animals play crucial roles in tropical forest ecosystems, and losing them could have repercussions for the health of the forest, according to Lim Jun Ying, an assistant professor from the National University of Singapore’s Plant Ecology, Evolution and Biogeography Laboratory. “Besides helping to disperse seeds, large herbivores such as elephants and tapirs also move nutrients throughout the forest when they poop,” Ying said. “The disturbances that they create, such as through trampling or consuming plants, can shape the vegetation around the forest understorey.” Studies have attempted to model how the loss of seed-dispersing animals could affect the ability of a tropical forest to absorb planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2). Through photosynthesis, tropical forests take in CO2 and with sunlight convert the carbon into biomass, such as tree trunks. By locking away carbon from the atmosphere, tropical forests are a key component in combating the climate crisis. But losing animals to traps and snares could impact a forest’s ability to store carbon. A 2019 study, modelled how the loss of large fruit-eating animals, such as hornbills and tapirs would affect a forest plot in Thailand. The report found that trees dependent on seed dispersal by large-bodied fruit dependent animals accounted for nearly one-third of the total carbon biomass on the plot. If the animals were lost, the forest would be less able to store carbon, the study found. But Lim said the impact of losing seed dispersers on a forest’s ability to store carbon varies from plot to plot, as this depends on various factors including what the dominant tree species in the area is, and what the climate of the area is like. All these differences affect how much carbon a forest can store. More studies are needed to quantify the impact of loss of wildlife on carbon storage of a forest, he added. Lim said it could take decades to centuries for the impacts of the loss of wildlife to manifest in forest health. “Many studies have detected changes in tree populations at their earliest life stages, such as in terms of seed or seedling density, but it’s yet unclear how these changes will eventually play out,” he said. Moreover, much is still unknown about forest dynamics. “While many species in tropical tree communities are dependent upon animal-mediated seed dispersal, we still don’t fully know which animals disperse which plants.” Lim is researching this gap by making use of natural experiments to look at the effect of megafauna, or large animals, on forest structure and carbon. “For example, megafauna are not evenly distributed throughout Asia, and so one could compare forest structure and carbon in areas where megafauna diversity is high versus areas where they are not.”A way forward The wildlife trade is complex. It involves a wide range of groups dependent on accessing the region’s forests and fauna for their livelihoods. But for many who rely on Southeast Asia’s forests, the broader implications of the ‘silent forests’ phenomena are not always clear. Nature sustains many rural communities, providing rural low income households free sources of protein and livelihood potential. But when city-dwellers add to the demand for bushmeat or exotic pets, which some may perceive as being symbols of wealth and prestige, demand outstrips the rate at which the animals can replenish themselves. “New technologies and access to markets may open up new opportunities for selling bushmeat, which would increase local economic returns,” said Michael Christie, a professor at Aberystwyth University in Wales and specialist in ecological and environmental economics. “But may be at the expense of other ecosystem services.” Christie chaired a report published in July 2022 by the United Nations’ science advisory panel for biodiversity, known as Ipbes, that had highlighted the myriad of ways that nature can be valued.The report also found that putting a narrow economic value on nature, and overlooking other non-market values associated with nature’s contribution to people, such as climate regulation, is one of the key reasons behind the loss and damage to the world’s ecosystems. Ng also noted that motivations for hunting wildlife can be diverse even within countries, and that it was important for policy makers to work with the local communities to understand the reasons for hunting. “If more people are engaging in snaring, I might ask what they were doing before, and what happened to motivate the switch. But if the same individuals are doing more snaring, then perhaps forest clearing forces more wildlife into smaller forest patches, making them easier to trap,” she said. “Urban consumers have the power to worsen or improve faraway landscapes,” she said, explaining that supporting human demands with practices, like livestock grazing, have their consequences.“What we end up with is a landscape with goats but without wild birdsong,” she said. Only the snapping of twigs could be heard as Chhoun Phirum, a community ranger in Cambodia’s Phnom Tnout Wildlife Sanctuary, carefully backed away from a line of snares he had discovered on patrol. He planned to leave the snares up as bait for the poachers. Phirum said being caught is the only way to change behaviours, a personal belief stemming from personal experience. After being caught and fined for snaring, Phirum transitioned from illegal poacher to ranger for BeTreed Adventures. His new mission, to protect the forest and safeguard the same wildlife he was once out to catch. “I would feel very happy if the forest is left standing tall,” Chhoun said. “I think that having more wildlife is better.” Additional reporting by Sophanna LayThis story was produced in collaboration with The Straits Times, with support from The Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Journalism Fund and Rainforest Investigations Network.",

          "text": "MONROE, LOUISIANA — The humidity was thick around 5 in the morning as birders in northeastern Louisiana geared up for a search expedition. After a second-straight stormy night, mosquitoes swarmed. We donned our headlamps, grabbed our hiking poles and headed north into the forest. We had to be in the “hot zone” by first light. Leading our pack was Matt Courtman, 61, tall and bearded and a true believer. At the tail end was his friend, Lynn Hightower. Both wore camo to blend into the woods—men turning invisible in pursuit of a grail. This, indeed, was no ordinary hike: For those in the know, it was a quest generations in the making—and one reasonable observers might describe as unthinkable. All was silence except when Courtman warned of sharp logs and poison ivy, noted bear prints or named the rhythmic sounds of birds, one by one, as they woke. Among them, Courtman hoped, was the creature he’d sought for years. The one whose image decorated virtually every room of his home. The one he’d built an online community to honor. The one he’d moved across the country to pursue: The Lord God Bird. The US Fish and Wildlife Service last September announced plans to take the grave and unusual step of removing the ivory-billed woodpecker from the endangered species list due to extinction. Thorough scrutiny of “the best scientific and commercial data available,” the agency told CNN, had determined the bird simply is extinct. But researchers and amateur birders, like Courtman, believed otherwise. \"I know from recent personal experience that the ivory bill is not extinct,” said Courtman, who claimed he’d encountered it at least twice: He had audio recordings—though not as clear as others’. And while the image of this bird was seared into his memory, he said, he’d never managed to snap a photo. People had searched for decades for traces of North America’s second largest woodpecker, whose population had declined since the 1880s because, researchers say, of excessive hunting, habitat destruction and perhaps the climate crisis. The government’s last accepted sighting of the species was by artist and birder Don Eckelberry in April 1944 in the same area CNN hiked with Courtman on his recent pursuit. Since then, some compelling—albeit controversial—research had emerged. But officials accepted none of it as indisputable proof. Some even quipped the ivory-billed woodpecker was another Bigfoot or Loch Ness Monster. Still, ivory bill devotees persisted, combing vast, wild expanses for any tiny shred of evidence of their treasured species. Now, the feds’ proposal had them rattled. Declaring the ivory bill extinct, advocates said, would trigger the pullback of measures that preserve its habitat, ironically becoming the nail in the coffin that truly would lead to its disappearance. The wildlife service insisted there would be “little to no change in the treatment of (ivory bills’) habitats” if they were declared extinct since land acquired for their conservation would still be protected for other species, it told CNN. But Courtman’s fear festered. \"Such a declaration could lead to the very thing that might cause the actual extinction of the beloved ivory bill—fragmentation of the magnificent large, unbroken, tracts of bottomland hardwood forests, which the bird relies on to survive. If that habitat was destroyed,” he said, “the ivory bills would not adapt, and so they'd be doomed to extinction.” Declaring extinct a species so revered for its elegance and strength could also shatter something perhaps more delicate: the long-held hope of people who have sought the ivory bill despite skeptics’ long glare and nature’s long odds. People like Courtman. And so, he intended to find it. Listen, now, for the Lord God Bird… At almost 6 a.m., birds across the old Singer Tract—part of the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge where the sewing machine company once sourced wood for its products—chirped in harmonies and knocked the trees. In this bottomland forest of oak, sweet gum and wild pecan, winter and early spring breeding seasons offer the best chance to spot the ivory-billed woodpecker, Courtman said. But on this morning, no birds sounded like the ivory bill. Former President Theodore Roosevelt chronicled spotting a few of them here in the early 1900s. And while the ivory bill’s range once stretched from Florida and South Carolina to Texas and Oklahoma, it was here the late Cornell University-educated ornithologist James Tanner in the 1930s gathered the clearest video and images of the majestic creature. The ivory-billed woodpecker’s divine nickname, per its devotees, echoes the gasps of those lucky enough ever to have seen it swoop into view. It is nearly 2 feet long, with a wingspan of almost 3 feet. And it boasts a gigantic chisel-shaped, ivory-white beak, with a protruding red crest in males and a black crest in females. Despite those distinctions, it could easily be mistaken for its slightly smaller cousin: the pileated woodpecker, which has a black bill. About a mile in, as we reached the hot zone, sunlight started to pour in. Along with the melodic chirps of awakening birds, we heard a powerful, quick drumming sound above us. “Is that the pileated?” I whispered to Courtman. “Yes, you’re starting to get it,” he said. Then, six chirps somewhere farther to the left. I looked at Courtman. “That’s the red-bellied woodpecker,” he said, adding, “I don’t anthropomorphize, but it’s probably saying, ‘I want food.’” To a non-birder’s eye, the pileated and ivory-billed woodpeckers might seem identical. In fact, many reports of ivory-billed woodpecker sightings have been shut down because they turned out to be pileated woodpeckers. Fervent birders usually tell them apart by the color of their wings and their distinct calling and drumming sounds. The ivory bill produces a quick, double-knock sound with its bill that slowly decrescendos, whereas the pileated makes a loud, slow, deep rolling sound that lasts for roughly three seconds. So far in our trek, we’d only heard the latter. … and be sure to bring a camera Courtman first got interested in ivory bills as a kid in Monroe, Louisiana. He grew up blocks from a prominent ornithologist, who at 8 let him hold an ivory bill specimen at the Louisiana State University’s Museum of Natural Science and at 12 listed him as a contributor to his 1974 book, “Louisiana Birds.” “Matt calls the woods his cathedral,” whispered Hightower, who admitted he isn’t as well-versed about birds as Courtman. Sitting on a camouflage-printed cushion, Hightower sometimes pulled out a book of birds to try to identify species he saw and heard. Searching for the ivory-billed woodpecker requires concentration and review. Since the 1944 sighting, the only other “compelling evidence” out there, according to the federal wildlife service, was 2005 research from Cornell’s renowned ornithologist John Fitzpatrick and his associates that claimed ivory bill sightings in eastern Arkansas’ Cache River National Wildlife Refuge. Fitzpatrick had launched a series of expeditions there soon after Tim Gallagher, the former editor-in-chief of Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Living Bird magazine, walked into his office the prior year and announced he and colleagues had seen the ivory-billed woodpecker while out on the Cache River. “A large black-and-white woodpecker with the characteristic color pattern of this species flew across the bayou at close range,” Gallagher wrote of the encounter. But they had no visual proof. “As soon as we landed, we took off through the boot-sucking muck and mire of the swamp, climbing up and over fallen trees and through branches, with camcorders in hand and running,” he wrote in a Cornell news blog in 2005. “Although the bird landed on tree trunks briefly a couple of times, we weren't able to catch up with it or take a video.” Fitzpatrick—taking in Gallagher’s tale in his office—was stunned and grabbed a recorder to document the mere conversation. “After he tells me the story, I said, ‘What are the chances this wasn’t an ivory bill?’ And Tim said, ‘Zero. It was an ivory bill, Fitz,’” Fitzpatrick recalled to CNN. \"So, I said, ‘Well, Tim, our lives are about to change.’ And they did.” Soon, a team of researchers—fully equipped with cameras and audio recorders—went back to the Cache River to try to nab evidence that would prove the ivory bill was still alive. But the task wasn’t easy: This bird is a whiz. Without finding an active roosting site—like Tanner did—birders say it can be near-impossible to document. Fitzpatrick’s 2005 evidence, published in the journal Science, included audio and video recordings, pixelated visuals and helicopter surveys. The findings were persuasive enough to trigger a large-scale, government-led, five-year survey of the ivory bill’s historical range, with some $2 million spent on survey work. Teams searched and searched. But over that time—and in the years that followed— “no conclusive evidence” of the bird emerged. The dearth highlighted a grim irony: The ivory-billed woodpecker had been among the animals that motivated Congress in 1973 to pass the Endangered Species Act. Strong evidence of the ivory bill’s survival remained scant as the Trump administration and its allies sought to pare back the landmark law that saved the bald eagle and grizzly bear. And so, even as President Joe Biden pledged to conserve 30% of the country’s lands and water to protect wildlife, the federal government moved last year to delist the ivory bill. An unexpected gift arrives… It's never easy, said Amy Trahan, an endangered species biologist from the federal wildlife service’s Louisiana Ecological Services Office who contributed to a 2019 review report concluding the ivory bill “no longer exists.” “We're biologists. … Our whole purpose is to recover species,” she told CNN. “We don't go into this career having to say something's extinct.” The government removes a species from the endangered and threatened species list for just three reasons: it's recovered so well it no longer needs the law’s protection; new information suggests it isn't threatened; or it's gone extinct. Removal helps the agency “to be good stewards of conservation resources,” it said. And removal is rare. Of over 700 animal species on the endangered species list, only 11 ever have been removed due to extinction—only four in the last 20 years, the agency confirmed. Just after the feds a year ago officially proposed delisting the ivory-billed woodpecker, a wave of stunned sadness spread among its adherents. But a nugget of hope remained: The public would have two months to weigh in before a final decision would be rendered a year out. Comments poured in—from ornithologists, from amateurs, from communities like the Cherokee Nation, whose leaders asserted the creature is a symbol whose “influence on our cultural activities remains to this day.” Equally enthusiastic birders also took the opposite view. The president of the Louisiana Ornithological Society—a role Courtman once held—was among the first submitters, with a comment stating the bird “should be declared extinct” and urging the feds not to focus on \"poor science” and “self-serving” claims it’s still out there. Courtman felt compelled to speak up, and as a one-time attorney, he had the requisite skills—if no longer the imprimatur. Sixteen years ago, he had been disbarred in what he called a “disastrous end” to his legal career over matters involving issuing worthless checks and misdemeanor convictions for theft. The mistakes, Courtman said, made for a “painful, embarrassing, and humbling experience”—but one that, with all its distress, helped focus the task now at hand: to get “everything right regarding the ivory bill.” “While certainly not perfect,” he said, “my efforts on behalf of the ivory bill have been to the best of my ability.” In his public comment to the wildlife service, Courtman laid out his reasons for opposing the extinction proposal. He also requested—and won—a public hearing at which he and other ivory bill seekers spoke—disciples testifying with an unwavering faith to what they claimed to have seen and heard. Still, though, no new, clear-cut proof of the bird had surfaced. And the calendar was running out. Then, amid the pressure from bird watchers and ornithologists, the wildlife service invited more public comment and announced a six-month extension, effectively postponing its ivory bill verdict into 2023. There had been “substantial disagreement regarding the interpretation of evidence that exists” for the ivory bill, wildlife officials told CNN in July. For the believers, it was a gift. A reprieve. More time. Courtman needed it. So did a research team convinced a pair of ivory bills was still alive. Around the time we trekked the old Singer Tract, the team known as Project Principalis—a nod to the ivory bill’s scientific name, Campephilus principalis—released a paper, still in the process of peer review, detailing evidence observed over the prior decade by Steve Latta, of the National Aviary, and colleagues including Tommy Michot, coauthor and research scientist retired from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and the US Geological Survey's Wetland and Aquatic Research Center. Using unmanned trail cameras and drones, they’d recently captured grainy pictures of what they claimed was the ivory bill. “We have some of the best images, if not the best images, that have been produced in 80 years,” Latta told CNN. And in a secret section of Louisiana’s marshes, they were still gathering data while seeking an active roosting site—and the high-quality images everyone expected. … but can’t restore what's lost The sun now lit our path in the Tensas woods, reflecting off tacks Courtman had placed toward tree cavities to signal nearby trunks with likely ivory bill scaling and nesting. The ivory bill requires up to 2,000 acres of undisturbed forest to feed on mostly long-horned beetles by scaling them off the outer bark of dead trees, he explained. After the Civil War, ramped-up hunting, mass draining of swamps and insatiable timber harvesting set in motion the ivory bill’s population decline, according to the late Cornell professor and ornithologist Arthur Allen, who took the world’s first photograph of the ivory bill in 1924 in Florida and later mentored Tanner. Meantime, the same factors that drove off the ivory bill also sparked an exodus of people who live and work on this land, including woodsmen who helped ornithologists spot the elusive bird, recalled the 81-year-old son of the late Singer Tract game warden Jesse Laird, who’d worked with Tanner and Eckelberry. “(My dad) was heartbroken,” said John Laird, who showed us worn photos of the old house on the Singer Tract where Tanner stayed. The climate crisis also may have harmed the ivory bill’s habitat, Latta said, pointing to models showing its impact on bottomland hardwood forests. Climate change already is killing off some species and will likely continue unless humans slash planet-heating emissions, a landmark February report backed by the United Nations noted. Warming temperatures, global scientists say, are influencing bird populations due to declining forest cover. However, Tanner in his book—dubbed the bible for the ivory-billed woodpecker—argued the Lord God Bird thrived in places where hurricanes and fires had devastated trees. More heat wave-fueled fires, hurricanes and coastal flooding can lead to more dead and dying trees, which may result in more wood-boring beetles and their larvae—prime ivory bill dinner. \"Some of this might be seen, in the short term,” Latta said, “as being beneficial potentially to the ivory bill.” A leader musters his crew… By 7:15 a.m., the sun was up. More birds chirped as we settled by the Tensas riverbank—a good sightline, Courtman said, for a flying ivory bill. His camera around his neck, a GoPro strapped to his head and binoculars at his eyes, Courtman was focused. He spoke often of how he encountered the ivory bill in 2017—when he recorded audio of it for three hours and heard dozens of its “kent” calls—then again in 2019, when he said he saw a pair of ivory bills. It was after his claimed 2019 sighting that Courtman, with his wife Lauren, decided to move back from Ohio to Monroe. “We knew that helping save the ivory bill would be our life's work,” he said, even though his sightings so far—like the evidence revealed by Fitzpatrick’s and, unofficially, Latta’s teams – hadn’t produced the sort of vital proof that could keep it on the protected species list. In the pandemic, Courtman and his wife created an impressive online ivory bill community from their home, a place awash in ivory bill images—on picture frames, a bookend, the kitchen light switch. And last October, following the extinction proposal announcement, they launched a weekly virtual gathering to talk about the enigmatic bird. Every Monday at 7 p.m., Courtman sits at his computer screen in his kitchen with Lauren—usually off-screen, handling technical glitches and clarifying talking points at a whisper—to organize slide shows and host other experts to discuss the ivory bill. At first, only a couple dozen people who’d learned of the meetings on Facebook joined. A guest speaker could draw at least 70 from across the country. Recently, some 130 people attended. “So far, we have hosted five PhDs, all of whom have explained why the ivory bill should not be declared extinct,” said Courtman, who founded the group, Mission Ivorybill. “For us as Americans, the ivory bill provides an opportunity to do something hopeful and spectacular—to save these breathtakingly beautiful birds from the brink of extinction.” Fitzpatrick, now retired as director emeritus of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has joined the Zoom calls. He’s hopeful the ivory-billed woodpecker is still out there. But unlike others in this tribe, he also accepts it may be gone. “I never felt an obligation or even that big of a personal desire to convince skeptics that I'm right, and they're wrong,” he said. “How you take the evidence is not up to me, it's up to you.” … and faith in things unseen To prove the ivory bill exists requires more than a sighting and an audio recording. Courtman played his 2017 recording for me, and it wasn’t as clear as the one Allen took in 1935 in Louisiana. Even the pixelated images and research Fitzpatrick declared as indisputable were criticized by ornithologists who said the audio did not match Tanner’s descriptions of the ivory bill’s raps or actually captured the pileated woodpecker. Ultimately, the wildlife service seeks “clear video or photographic evidence ... that can be repeatedly interpreted the same way by independent observers,” it said, noting the standard mirrors protocols in the 2010 Recovery Plan. Something deeper might also be out there for those in the throes of this search—something Latta felt in Louisiana in 2019, when on the same search as Courtman he says he got “one of the best looks at the ivory-billed woodpecker than anyone has had in generations.” “It left me literally shaking.” That’s because for all his fieldwork, Latta hadn’t believed the ivory bill still lived: “I do not chase rarities,” he later wrote. But after that claimed sighting, “for two or three nights,” he said, “I couldn't sleep. I felt this responsibility that, because I had seen this and that I knew it existed, I now have this responsibility to do what I could to conserve it.” Federal officials—on their own expanded timeline—were still reviewing hundreds of public comments this fall en route to a final judgment on delisting the bird from the endangered species docket. All the while, the birders kept searching. “There are a lot of things out there in science that we don't know the answer to yet, but slowly, we find the answers, and sometimes it takes years or decades,” Michot said. “The fact that humans can't say for sure whether the bird exists or not is a compelling way to make a person want to go out and find it.” Walking months earlier through the Louisiana forest, Courtman used bird calls to signal us on our expedition’s return leg: right, left, stop, straight. We waded through muddy water that washed away a spider I hadn’t seen crawling on my right boot. Soon, we stepped back onto the paved road and unloaded our gear. It was around 9 a.m. The air, still a bearable 70 degrees, now was less humid. Standing outside our vehicles, we refueled on granola bars and soaked in the sounds of the forest one last time. Then, we got into our cars and drove away, Courtman looking ahead to the next search—then the next and the next. “I am confident,” he told me, still steeped in firm belief, “that ivory bills are not extinct.”",

          "text": "Tahir Shawl Birds always captivate our fascination. Whether we wander along a mountain stream, move deep into the woods or stroll through our lawns, gardens, streets or lanes, our eyes hardly miss a flitting, hopping or chirping bird. They are almost everywhere, in almost any kind of habitat around us, provided we have a passionate eye to appreciate and enjoy their beauty. Let’s go birding We owe a lot to our feathered friends and they genuinely deserve our love, care and protection. The best way to show our concern for birds and nature is to understand them and their environment by resorting to bird watching also called birding. Birding indeed is considered as the most enjoyable pastime. Being civilized humans we strongly owe a responsibility to contribute to the cause of nature and biodiversity conservation which includes birds and their habitat. This paves way for civilized living and contributes to maintaining healthy environment. To be a birdwatcher one needs not to possess a professional degree in ornithology or nature science. In fact non professional or amateur birdwatchers have contributed a lot to the field of ornithology and natural history. It is rightly said that ornithology is the only field where an amateur bird watcher is equally at home with a professional ornithologist. The best time for bird watching is morning. Birds are most active during this period regardless of any season. In the afternoon they once again become active. So it is important to take into consideration the time before you set off for birding. How Many of Them Are There Although our country accounts for about four percent of global area, we enjoy a variety of landscape with altitudinal and seasonal variation supporting a profusely rich bird life. We boast of bird species higher in number than many other regions larger manifold in size than India. We are one of the 12 mega diversity regions. Of the approximately 10906 species of birds reported in the world our Subcontinent is home to about 1300 species. If we take into account the sub-species or geographical races including the migratory ones the total number goes up to about 2100 approximately. The endemism accounts for about 78 species. It means 78 species are exclusive to our region and not reported from other areas. We can’t be callous. Unfortunately ruthless poaching, hunting and burgeoning pressure on bird habitats has pushed many species into dangerous zones under Red Data Book of IUCN and wiped many to extinction. Birds like mountain quail, pink headed duck and Blewitt’s spotted owlet are a few examples that are considered to have gone extinct in this century. A considerable number of species of birds in India have entered the Red Data Book owing to their threatened status. IUCN places threatened birds under various categories like critically endangered/ endangered, vulnerable and near-threatened. Do we need to save them? Birds play a very significant and pivotal role in our ecosystem. We cannot afford at all to overlook their importance and regard them impassively. They are immensely valuable as they check pests and vermin act as scavengers by cleaning our environment, facilitate pollination, besides being an important link in food chain and hold aesthetic value. Many birds, like vultures, keep our environment clean and healthy by feeding on dead and rotten animals. Birds of prey like eagles, owls and kites keep a check on population of rodents like mice and rat that cause heavy damage to our crops. Their droppings are source of rich manure. Due to their sensitivity to environmental changes and fast metabolism they act as “indicator species” and reflect the health of prevailing environment, thereby signaling a timely warning system. Talking of Jammu & Kashmir The Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir is home to around 554 known species of birds. It lies in the Endemic Bird Area in Western Himalayas. Varied climatic and geographical conditions make it one of the richest biodiversity regions in India. Our wetlands brim with a large variety of spectacular water birds including geese, ducks, cranes and waders which throng mostly in winters. The avian diversity, with around 620 species observed in J&K and Ladakh, is quite rich and includes many threatened and restricted range species. Around 14 bird species are under threatened category including 2 critically endangered, 09 vulnerable and 03 near threatened. Around 11 species are considered as Restricted Range Species. What do Birdwatchers want to See in J&K Bird watchers, eco-tourists and wildlife photographers from across the world like to visit Jammu and Kashmir in their quest to see hundreds of amazing bird species. There are some very special bird species which are either restricted range species with sparse distribution, endemic to western Himalaya or those that breed only in Jammu & Kashmir. Serious bird watchers and wildlife photographers would almost die to see Kashmir flycatcher, Spectacled finch, Orange bullfinch ,Tawny owl, European bee-eater, Kashmir nuthatch, Kashmir nutcracker, Palla’s fish eagle, golden eagle, Rook, Marbled teal, White-headed duck, Lesser white fronted goose , Koklas, Cheer pheasant, Western tragopan, Monal pheasant and of course Black-necked crane in Ladakh and many other species. Exploring bird tourism potential Importance of birds in generating livelihood through eco-tourism or bird tourism has been gaining the attention of governments and tourists are travelling to destination where they can easily watch and photograph birds and enjoy nature. Countries like Kenya, Tanzania, Costa Rica, and Mexico, etc, have earned the reputation of being amongst the most sought after destinations for bird watching and eco-tourism and this contributes substantially to their economy. Bird watching can boost economic opportunities and benefit rural communities. Despite immense potential and opportunities the eco-tourism has rather remained under exploited and needs to be explored to its full potential. The Tourism department in collaboration with local bird watchers, wildlife Protection department and forest department can explore to offer facilities and logistic support to the eco-tourists or bird watchers keeping in focus, at the same time, the conservation ethos of environment and welfare of local people. Local youth can be trained as nature tour-guides to build their capacity to conduct and guide the eco-tourists in field. The possibility of establishing home-stays by local communities for the nature tourists has immense potential in Jammu Kashmir. Special trainings and workshops for tour operators, hoteliers and tour guides can help a great deal in boosting bird tourism. Some worthwhile birding sites Although the entire Jammu and Kashmir region is rich in avifaunal diversity, some of the 55 wildlife protected areas, in J&k and Ladakh, comprising of national parks, sanctuaries, conservation reserves and wetland reserves offer excellent destinations for bird watching. Nearly 21 Important Bird Areas (IBAs), recognized by the Birdlife International and BNHS, have been prioritized on the basis of rich avian assemblage and diversity. Dachigam National Park, Limber, Overa, Auru, Gulmarg, Pehalgam, Sonamarg, Budgam, Yusmarg, Zabbarwan and Shankaracharya hills Srinagar city are some of good areas for a bird watcher near Srinagar in Kashmir. For migratory and resident water fowl Hokersar, Mirgund, Haigham and Shallabugh wetlands are best for birding around Srinagar in winter. Similarly Gharana wetland in R.S.Pura near Jammu offers a rich assemblage of migratory waterfowl. Samba, Vijaypur and Kathua on Jammu-Pathankot route also offer good opportunity of birding. Ramnagar Sanctuary, Reika, Mahamaya, Tawi riverbed and Jammu University campus are some good sites for birding in Jammu town. Dehra ki Galli, an IBA, Aiti, Fatehpur, Darhali, Baba Gulam Shah Badshah University are some of the good birding sites near Rajouri town. Chenab Valley including Badherwa, Doda, and Kishtwar National Park are also worth visiting.

          "title": "Wildlife crime hits record high with badgers, bats and birds of prey targeted",
          "text": "Crime against wildlife has reached “record levels” following a surge in rates during Covid lockdown, according to a new report. The range of offences include hare coursing, persecution of birds of prey, killing badgers and bats, and the disturbance of seals and dolphins, as well as the illegal trade in wildlife. The Wildlife and Countryside Link – a coalition of 67 wildlife organisations including the RSPB, WWF and National Trust – said its annual Wildlife Crime Report reveals 1,414 wildlife crime incidents, up slightly from 1,404 a year earlier. The report reveals that 42 defendants were convicted of hunting crimes, including the illegal hunting of foxes with dogs, up from 17 in 2020 and a previous high of 32 in 2016, but the authors said for hunting crimes more than half (53 per cent) of prosecutions were unsuccessful in securing a conviction in 2021. This is compared to an 82 per cent conviction rate across all crime. \"A lack of training and resources is central to this issue,\" the report’s author’s said. The report separately examines figures for crimes recorded in fisheries, with 3,337 fisheries crime reports in 2021, down from 4,163 in 2020. The authors of the report warned that current government action may be weakening environmental protections and exposing the natural world to greater risk. In particular, the government’s controversial Retained EU Law Bill, which is fast-tracking the cutting of around 2,400 laws which originated from the EU by the end of the year, could result in many protections for species and ecosystems being lost, the campaigners warned. Instead, they are calling for wildlife crimes to be officially recorded by the Home Office, as they say this will help police forces strategically plan operations against such crimes. They are also calling for \"better training and resources for police forces and prosecution teams\", as convictions for wildlife crimes remain at very low numbers. For example, the report reveals that reports of raptor persecution rose to their second highest on record in 2021, to 302 incidents. This resulted in just three convictions, but this tiny figure is more than any other over the past six years. Dr Richard Benwell, chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “Wildlife crime soared during the pandemic and remained at record levels this year. Progress on convictions is positive, and we welcome Defra’s efforts to stiffen sentencing, but overall that is of little use while the rate of successful prosecutions remains so low. “The snapshot in our report is likely to be a significant under-estimate of all kinds of wildlife offences. To get to grips with these cruel crimes, the Home Office should make wildlife crime notifiable, to help target resources and action to deal with hotspots of criminality.\" He added: “The Retained EU Law Bill threatens to be a serious distraction, and could even lead to important wildlife laws being lost. Instead, seven years on from its publication, the government should implement the Law Commission’s 2015 wildlife law report. \"Surely it is better to spend time and money improving laws that are as much as two centuries old, than wasting time reviewing effective environmental laws under the REUL bill.” Martin Sims, chair of Link’s wildlife crime working group, said: “We must empower police forces to act on wildlife crime. \"We already see how, with proper resources and training, a real difference can be made in the work against awful crimes like hare coursing. It’s the counties with well-funded and resourced projects in place where we’re seeing the most positive progress. \"Also essential to efforts to better protect our wildlife is making wildlife crime notifiable, and recorded in national statistics. This would better enable police forces to gauge the true extent of wildlife crime and to plan strategically to address it.” A Defra spokesperson told The Independent: “We are clear those found guilty of harming animals should be subject to the full force of the law, which is why we have doubled funding for the National Wildlife Crime Unit to over £1.2 million for the next three years – supporting them to provide intelligence and advice to police forces to protect our precious animals. “Significant sanctions are available to judges to hand down to those convicted - most wildlife crimes carry up to an unlimited fine and/or a six-month custodial sentence.”",

          "text": "Crimes against wildlife, from bats to badgers and bluebells, remained at record levels in 2021 after hitting new highs the previous year, a report has said. Research using data from nature organisations in the absence of formal statistics reveals there were 1,414 reported wildlife crime incidents last year, not including fishing and fisheries, similar to the number seen in 2020. Conservation groups warn that the scale of wildlife crime is likely to be far higher. The annual wildlife crime report, compiled by the Wildlife and Countryside Link coalition of nature groups, also revealed that convictions for most wildlife crimes rose from record lows in 2020. The report highlights what can be done with resources, training and legislation, with the focus on tackling hare coursing – including new laws and a nationwide police effort – helping secure an increase in convictions in 2021. But conservationists warn that the Government’s Retained EU Law Bill could undermine efforts to tackle wildlife crime, as they fear it could lead to the dropping or hasty rewriting of European legislation to protect nature, potentially weakening it. Nature experts are calling for action to make wildlife crimes notifiable to the Home Office so they are officially recorded in national statistics to help gauge the true extent of the problem. They also want to see increased resources and training for police forces, reform of wildlife crime legislation, much of which is fragmented and antiquated, and the immediate withdrawal of the Retained EU Law Bill. The report looks at crimes ranging from the persecution of birds of prey, badgers and bats, to hare coursing and illegal hunting, the illicit wildlife trade, theft of wild bluebells, orchids and fungi, and disturbance of seals and dolphins. Information was provided by a range of groups including the RSPB, WWF UK, Plantlife and the League Against Cruel Sports. Analysis showed that reported wildlife crimes apart from fisheries were above 1,400 for the second year in a row, after a jump from 1,056 in 2019 to 1,401 in 2020. Reported fisheries crimes, which range from fishing without a rod licence to salmon poaching and illegal sea fisheries activities, stood at 3,337 in 2021, down from 4,163 the year before. However, the report said many of the “illegal fishing incidents” reported in 2020 were more about perceived breaches of Covid regulations and people being “out” when they should not be, and overall the pandemic had an impact in reducing confirmed fisheries crime. Elsewhere, the pandemic contributed to high wildlife crime reporting figures in both 2020, in several ways, Wildlife and Countryside Link said. Opportunistic offenders may have taken advantage of the police focus on enforcing social restrictions to commit crime, while increased use of the countryside and coast meant more members of the public were present to witness and report concerning incidents. More domestic tourism played a role in increased disturbance of dolphins and other marine mammals. Wildlife and Countryside Link chief executive Dr Richard Benwell said: “Wildlife crime soared during the pandemic and remained at record levels this year. “Progress on convictions is positive, and we welcome Defra’s (the Environment Department) efforts to stiffen sentencing, but overall that is of little use while the rate of successful prosecutions remains so low. “The snapshot in our report is likely to be a significant under-estimate of all kinds of wildlife offences. “To get to grips with these cruel crimes, the Home Office should make wildlife crime notifiable, to help target resources and action to deal with hotspots of criminality.” He added: “The Retained EU Law Bill threatens to be a serious distraction, and could even lead to important wildlife laws being lost. “Surely it is better to spend time and money improving laws that are as much as two centuries old, than wasting time reviewing effective environmental laws under the REUL Bill.”",

          "title": "Crowds flock to Jurong Bird Park ahead of last day of operations on Jan 3",
          "text": "When social worker Jed Wong was 25 and staying overnight at the penguin enclosure at the Jurong Bird Park as part of a camp he organised for children, he thought the park would be a fun spot for a date with his girlfriend. He took his girlfriend of several years there, where they got up close and personal with talking parrots. Ten years later, they are married and back at the park with their two sons, aged 10 months and 2½ years, on the last weekend ahead of its last day of operations on Jan 3. “The kids enjoy the shows and water play,” said 31-year-old Ezabella Seitoh, who is a housewife. “But I’m happy the bird park is moving to (Mandai Wildlife Reserve) because we stay in Yishun.” It will join the Singapore Zoo, River Wonders and Night Safari there, as well as Mandai’s other upcoming attractions, including Rainforest Wild and a new resort operated by Banyan Tree Hotels & Resorts. For Ms Mary Chee who came to the park with her friend on Saturday, the bird park was the last attraction she visited with her parents 25 years ago, before her mother died a few months later. The customer service officer, who is single and in her 50s, recounted taking her late parents there on a company-sponsored Family Day outing 25 years ago. Ms Chee said it was a rare occasion and a memorable one, as she had not often been able to spend time with her parents at local attractions. “I remember my mum was very happy when she opened the lunch box (provided by the company) and there was chicken wing,” she added. When The Straits Times visited the park at 9am on Saturday, it was a hive of activity, with a steady stream of visitors, both local and foreign. The first Kings Of The Skies presentation at 10am, featuring eagles, vultures and an owl, saw seats packed and many other visitors watching from outside the arena. Visitorship to the Jurong Bird Park, which has welcomed more than 40 million guests since it opened in 1971, has almost doubled since its closure date was announced in August, said its operator Mandai Wildlife Group. At its peak, the park had over 8,000 visitors in a single day on Dec 26 – four times the daily average of about 2,000. Tickets were priced at just $10 from Nov 19 to Jan 3 following the announcement of the park’s closing. Several people, who recounted visiting during a primary school excursion, took a trip down memory lane on Saturday with their children in tow. They came from all corners of Singapore. “The kids woke up at 6am because they know we’re going to the bird park today,” said 36-year-old shipping executive Amerlyn Wong, who turned up with her husband and children, aged two and five. The family of four live in Punggol. “It’s our first time, and also our last,” she added. Some visitors, such as Mr Waleed Al Ali from the United Arab Emirates, were surprised to learn that the attraction was closing in days. It was the civil servant’s last day of his one-week holiday in Singapore with his wife and six children, aged three to 11. He said his brother-in-law back home kept a dome with different kinds of parrots – from Asian to Brazilian types – which his children love, and they were excited to see other species of birds. “The kids really like Singapore now,” he added. After its closure, the 20ha park’s about 130 employees and about 3,500 birds will prepare to move to Bird Paradise in Mandai Wildlife Reserve. Mandai Wildlife Group said in October that preparations for the move from Jurong Bird Park to Bird Paradise started more than three years ago. Over the last two years, aviaries in the bird park were rethemed to mirror the new habitats in Bird Paradise. This was so they could start introducing different bird species that would be housed in the same habitat at the new park that is set to open in the second quarter of 2023. Conditioning enclosures were placed in aviaries to allow the birds to get used to them. The birds will be transported to Mandai in these enclosures over a few months, the group said. It added that the move is a “massive undertaking” and more than 100 steps need to be taken to complete the transfer of each batch of birds. “Upon release into their new homes, the birds will be closely monitored to ensure they are adjusting well and given sufficient time to settle into their new environments,” it said. Ms Chee said: “Jurong Bird Park, the location and the memories made here will be missed.” 5 milestones in 52 years of Jurong Bird Park Singapore’s oldest wildlife park will close after Jan 3 and relocate to Bird Paradise in Mandai Wildlife Reserve. Here are five milestones in its 52-year history. In 1988, the Fuji Hawk Centre, now known as Hawk Arena, was officially launched. The Kings Of The Skies presentation was introduced, showcasing the natural behaviours of raptors such as the bald eagle, brahminy kite and Himalayan griffon vulture. In 2010, the penguin exhibit underwent a major upgrade and was renamed the Penguin Coast. During the revamp, an outdoor exhibit was also built specially for the African penguins to swim in the pool or retreat to their air-conditioned den. Found only on the south-western coast of Africa, the African penguins are perfectly adapted to cool or warm temperatures. In 2018, 60 rescued Santa Cruz ground doves were taken to Jurong Bird Park by the joint efforts of zoos globally to form the world’s first assurance colony of the endangered species outside their native range. Breeding efforts saw the initial flock grow to more than 90, with the ultimate goal of returning them to their native Solomon Islands to replenish the wild population. In 2019, a pair of Philippine eagles arrived under a wildlife loan agreement with the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources in collaboration with the Philippine Eagle Foundation. The arrival of the pair, named Geothermica and Sambisig, marked the first time that the species had been sent outside their native country. In 2021, a rare wild cinereous vulture captured national attention when it veered off its usual migratory path and landed in Singapore near the Botanic Gardens. Despite having no visible injury, the heavy bird was found in a weakened state and unable to fly. After receiving veterinary care at the Jurong Bird Park’s hospital, the vulture eventually managed to take flight, with encouragement from park staff.",

          "title": "Illegal animal trade, hunting threaten multimillion naira wildlife tourism industry",
          "text": "Alexander Okere writes about how illegal trading and hunting of animals continue to undermine wildlife tourism John Samuel was swift in alighting from his pick-up truck at the entrance of the popular Oluwo Fish Market in the Epe area of Lagos. He dashed into the market, holding down his t-shirt with one hand to cover his protuberant belly and grabbing a sack blackened by dirt. Visitors unfamiliar with the nature of business in the market would have thought the 46-year-old restaurateur in the Ajah area of the state was fleeing an impending disaster. But considering the insatiable craving for bush meat among Nigerians and the rarity of such delicacy in local markets, Samuel’s burst of energy was understandable. He wasted no time haggling over the price for the carcass of two young duikers; a species of antelopes, killed in a neighbouring forest in Ogun State by a hunter and valued at N20,000 each. On the table of one of the female traders were the carcasses of two grasscutters, one of them already decomposing; a porcupine, a young monitor lizard, a civet, and a small crocodile with its fore and hind limbs tied with twine around its back. She struggled to keep flies away from the dead animals but the two-winged insects could not resist the putrid smell. One of the traders threw the dead civet toward Samuel, anticipating a quick bargain but he did not seem interested in the ‘bushmeat’ which appeared too burnt and unappealing. He quickly tucked the dead antelopes in the sack and sat on one of the slaughter slabs in the market awaiting his next purchase. Some of the female traders laughed and teased him as they watched the drama unfolding, confirming that he was a familiar face in the market. But a few minutes later, the restaurateur quickly dumped the sack at the back of his truck and zoomed off shortly after obliging our correspondent his name, thinking he was a law enforcement officer in mufti. However, one of the traders, Ranti Owoyemi, who claimed to have traded in the market for over 20 years, said Samuel was trying to get the best deals at the earliest time possible due to the scarcity occasioned by the difficulty faced by hunters who struggled to hunt the largely nocturnal animals when there was a full moon. She said, “We get the carcasses of different wild animals from hunters who come from Ijebu Ode, Ibadan, and Lagos, but lately only a few of them supply the bushmeat because any time the moon shines brightly, the animals hardly come out because they could be easily seen by hunters. So, the man (Samuel) knows that if he is not fast enough, other buyers will grab the best market (carcasses) at higher prices and leave the ones that are not attractive for the latecomers. “In Yorubaland, native doctors demand the pangolin; they say it is used for the treatment of pregnant women. We used to sell some at between N3,000 and N5,000, depending on the size, before we were warned by the government to stop selling pangolins.’’ Nigeria’s endangered fauna The consumption of wild animals as meat in Nigeria has increased over the years, leaving many of the country’s fauna, including monitor lizards, antelopes, crocodiles, porcupines, tortoises, and pythons, endangered or at risk of extinction. Daily, these animals are at the mercy of hunters who kill them for subsistence and commercial purposes. A hunter in the Ile-Oluji area of Ondo State, Sunkanmi Dada, told our correspondent that he had been in the business of hunting wild animals all his life as he was born into a family of hunters. “Yes, my children both at home and abroad are trained with the money I make from hunting. I have killed many wild animals. It is only the elephant that I have not killed. I use a gun to kill them. When we kill those animals, we eat some and sell some to the bushmeat sellers you see along the expressways. Depending on the size of the animal, a big antelope now is sold for between N25,000 and N30,000,” he said. A survey by WildAid, an international organisation that works to reduce the global consumption of wildlife products and increase local conservation efforts, revealed that wildlife in Nigeria faces threats from poaching for body parts and meat. It stated that as of 2021, Nigeria recorded a decline in the population of elephants, crocodiles, gorillas, antelope, and chimpanzees, while some species, such as pangolins, were either endangered or on the brink of extinction, a situation that has constantly drawn the attention of conservation advocates in Nigeria. “Nigeria has a problem,” the founder, Greenfingers Wildlife Conservation Initiative, Chinedu Mogbo, said of persistent endangering of wildlife. Magbo lamented that chimpanzees, drills, red Colobus monkeys, and other primates were critically endangered, noting that there were only 50 African lions left in Nigeria. He further noted that giraffes went extinct in Nigeria in 2006 and the country no longer had rhinos. “The African forest elephant is also on the critically endangered list. For the smaller species, there are the white-bellied pangolin, the African crowned crane, and others,” he added. With a first-class degree in Biomedical Sciences at the De Montfort University, Leicester, United Kingdom; and a master’s in Public Health at the University of Warwick, Mogbo was headed for a successful medical career. But his passion for wildlife protection and the need to protect Nigeria’s endangered animals from poachers informed his career switch. Twelve years ago, he founded the organisation, focusing on the rescue, protection, and rehabilitation of Nigeria’s endangered fauna at a wildlife sanctuary, their release into protected spaces, and wildlife education. “I could see the problem Nigeria had when it came to wildlife. I felt that I needed to somehow contribute in my way to change the narrative for wildlife in Nigeria. That was basically what inspired the journey. We run a wildlife sanctuary where we cater to animals that have been rescued. It houses over 110 different wild animals,” he said. Multimillion naira illicit wildlife business More worrisome is the trafficking and sale of hides and other animal parts by poachers and their accomplices. Painting a global picture of the menace, a professor of Environmental Law and Policy, Olanrewaju Fagbohun (SAN), said poaching and illegal wildlife trafficking had reached unprecedented levels. “Illegal wildlife trade is believed to be the world’s fourth most valuable illicit commerce after drugs, human trafficking, and the arms trade. In financial terms, some estimates put the worth of illicit wildlife and plant trade at between €8bn and €20bn annually, while some have placed the estimate at between $15bn and $20bn or $10bn and $23bn per year,” Fagbohun, a former Vice-Chancellor of the Lagos State University, said at the 16th Chief S. L. Edu Memorial Lecture, organised by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation in 2018. Similarly, WildAid noted that in addition to bushmeat consumption, Nigeria had emerged as the primary transit hub in Africa for ivory and pangolin scales exported to Asian countries, adding that the country was linked to about half of all pangolin scale seizures globally between 2016 and 2019. Indeed, the recurrence of seizures by the Nigerian government underscores how deep-rooted the problem is. In February 2020, the Nigeria Customs Service said it intercepted smuggled pangolin scales valued at N10.26bn along the Isheri axis of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. In August 2021, it intercepted a haul of pangolin scales and elephant tusks worth N22.3bn in Lagos. The Comptroller General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (retd.), said the 196 sacks of pangolin scales seized in August 2021 weighed 17,137.44 kilograms; the pangolin claws weighed 4.60kg while the elephant tusks weighed 870.44 kg. Why poaching, illegal trade thrive Findings by Saturday PUNCH showed that in addition to a low level of wildlife education and conservation, laws protecting wildlife in Nigeria are poorly enforced. In 2016, the Federal Government amended the Endangered Species (Control of International Trade and Traffic) (Amendment) Act to increase fines under the First Schedule from N1,000 to N500,000 or five years’ imprisonment, or both for offenders who hunt or trade in endangered species such as pangolins, sea turtles, civets, monkeys, and pythons. “With regard to the Second Schedule, fines were increased to N300,000 ($770) or three years in prison or both. Airlines, shippers, or cargo handlers who freight illegal wildlife products now pay a fine of N2m ($5,128). However, the law is rarely enforced, as seen with many other wildlife laws, such as the National Environmental (Protection of Endangered Species in International Trade) Regulations 2011, which has a maximum fine of N5m ($13,137) and a three-year jail term for people involved in wildlife-related crimes,” the WildAid survey added. Greed is another driving force, with hunters, poachers, and their collaborators capturing and killing endangered species for monetary gains. “It is a major problem. It is corruption and greed because they (poachers) know the worth of these animals and their parts. There is another part of this wildlife trade that is happening that has not been exposed. This is an international pet trade where indigenous wildlife is taken and exported to other countries because they are sold for huge amounts of money. Nobody is talking about it. The pangolin and rhinos are part of Africa’s wildlife that is being decimated,” Mogbo said. “Unfortunately, some of these things are not being done by locals; they are done by foreigners who come to Nigeria and use the locals to fuel the trade. The hunters are just part of the long chain. Some of the people mainly involved have a strong network where they can even pull the string of government officials. “For example, if a seizure has been made, they can pull strings to have those materials returned to them even after they have been seized and publicly declared. But it (illegal wildlife) will actually trickle down to the hunters who will go in search of the animals and gather them,” he added. The National Public Relations Officer of the NCS, Timi Bomadi, said illegal wildlife traders arrested by the Customs, made fruitless efforts to bribe officers to get the seized items released or get a soft landing. He said, “It is something that we have not relented in fighting against and I think just last month, the CGC Strike Force in Lagos also had seizures of pangolin scales. We have been consistent in our fight against the illicit wildlife trade. “We get a lot of cooperation from even international bodies. We are working with a few European governments, some wildlife conservationists, and even the locals. It’s a huge intelligence-gathering exercise. Most of the wildlife is not domiciled in Nigeria but they (traffickers) want to use Nigeria as a transit route to either Asia or Europe. “We noticed that there are non-Nigerians, like a case that is being prosecuted in court. Foreign nationals are engaged in the trade. It is notorious because they have been tracked even by the international police. Eventually, we got them arrested and they are currently being prosecuted in our courts.” Illegal wildlife trade now cyber-enabled It was further gathered that while the government’s efforts to stamp out illegal wildlife trade in Nigeria appear to be yielding some results, the perpetrators are moving their activities online. TRAFFIC, a leading non-governmental organisation working on wildlife trade in the context of both biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, said threatened African species were facing increasing danger from an unregulated and illegal cyber-enabled wildlife trade in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon. “While these countries have policies in place for physical marketplaces, unregulated online market sellers are taking advantage of a lack of cyber-related legislation. Seventy-nine per cent of the observed online advertisements were found in Nigeria, which along with Gabon, also represented the highest number of live species for sale. Seventy per cent of all the products found for sale in this survey were live birds and monkeys, thought to be advertised for the exotic pet trade. “The ongoing concern is that 90 per cent of the sellers were listing on platforms which instruct buyers to meet sellers to exchange and pay for goods in person, making it difficult for law enforcement to intercept packages or even prove the sale,” it said in a July 2022 report on cyber-enabled wildlife trade in Central African countries and Nigeria. Corroborating this, Fagbohun said relevant agencies in countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, and Chile were properly resourced both in terms of manpower and requisite facilities, with technology playing a major role to monitor and detect illicit wildlife trade. Impact on Nigeria’s environment Decrying the impact of wildlife depletion occasioned by the illegal trade in Nigeria, Fagbohun explained that biosecurity risk was a major problem. According to the World Health Organisation, 75 per cent of emerging infectious diseases in the last decade have been traced to animals. Illegal wildlife can diminish species populations to the point of extinction as has been seen with some animals such as rhinoceros, lions, and others. “This will ultimately lead to severe economic losses. Loss of biodiversity through illegal wildlife can also threaten ecosystem functions and the destruction of local communities. There is the threat of harm and violence to rangers, conservation officials, police officers, and members of the community assisting these officials. The significant amount of money involved further heightens the risk of corruption, strengthens criminal networks, and fuels social instability,” Fagbohun stated. Countries make fortune from wildlife tourism Reports showed that while wildlife struggles for survival in Nigeria, some countries are taking advantage of their fauna to boost their economy and provide jobs through tourism. In 2018 alone, tourism contributed $8bn to the South African economy, accounting for 2.8 per cent of its GDP. It also created 716,000 jobs, about 4.6 per cent of the country’s total employment, according to Investec, an anglo-South African international banking and wealth management group. Brazil made $103.5bn from tourism and travel in 2021, contributing 6.4 per cent to its GDP, while Nigeria earned $16m from the sector, accounting for 3.6 per cent of the nation’s GDP, the World Travel and Tourism Council said in its 2021 economic impact report. “In the absence of reliable data, it is difficult to estimate how much Nigeria is losing to this illegal trade. Against the background of the pieces of evidence scattered all over, Nigeria is losing billions of dollars on a yearly basis,” Fagbohun added. Conservationists canvass moderate consumption A professor of Wildlife Conservation at the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, Augustine Ezealor, while blaming the high demand, consumption, and decline of Nigeria’s endangered species on poverty, said wildlife consumption must be planned to accommodate their reproduction and continuous existence. He said, “It is more of a problem of poverty than orientation. Telling some people not to consume bushmeat is like telling them not to consume meat at all. We destroy wildlife at our peril. Wildlife doesn’t breathe air differently from the one we breathe, so if we soil their environment, we are indirectly soiling our environment. We must learn to coexist with wildlife. “I am not saying people should not eat them but it must be a planned harvest. You go in, take a few and allow others to multiply and let the species exist. But here (in Nigeria), we kill the ‘father’, ‘mother’, and offspring of wild animals. I saw a young man who had harvested giant African rats; he smoked them out of their hole and killed the entire family.” Also, a professor of Wildlife Ecology, Nutrition, Ecotourism, and Hospitality at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Ondo State, Adebisi Adeyemo, noted that the government must be intentional about protecting wildlife and promoting tourism. “Kenya, for instance, depends on wildlife tourism. So, if we enhance wildlife tourism in Nigeria, more people will come from different countries to see our animals and it will bring in a lot of revenue. Ecotourism can bring in millions of naira and become a major source of revenue,” Adeyemo said. Health implications for wildlife consumers At the onset of the Ebola crisis in 2014 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, several restrictions introduced by federal and state governments reduced the sale and consumption of bushmeat among Nigerians. But lovers and traders of the commodity soon returned to their pastime. However, health experts warned that the consumption of wild animals remained a health risk. For instance, the monitor lizard is said to be a possible carrier of disease-causing bacteria that can result in food poisoning. But is it safe for humans to eat? “No, it is not completely safe to consume lizards as food. Lizards may carry various disease-causing bacteria, including Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and Staphylococcus aureus. These bacteria can cause a food-borne illness or food poisoning,” said Dr Oladipo Kolawole, a virologist and Head of the Microbiology Department at Adeleke University, Ede, Osun State. “There are over 150 zoonotic diseases worldwide, which are transmitted to humans by both wild and domestic animal populations, 13 of which are responsible for 2.2 million deaths per year,” Kolawole added. According to him, some zoonotic diseases such as rabies, which are infections spread between people and animals, caused by germs, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi, could be severe and life-threatening, thus posing a health risk for bushmeat consumers. “Yes, they (consumers) are at a high risk of contracting zoonotic diseases, bushmeat hunting, butchering, and consumption is widely considered to be the primary risk factor for human-wildlife contact and zoonotic viral transmission. Rodents, rats, monkeys, and small antelope (duikers and chevrotains) are the most commonly cited species in cases of zoonosis transmission between animals and humans. “The symptoms depend on the type of the animals that were consumed and the pathogen present. This will vary according to the pathogenesis of the involved pathogen and the host of concern. Some of the signs and symptoms are diarrhoea (which can be severe), abdominal cramps, poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, pain, fever, body aches, headache, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes among others,” Kolawole, who is also an international fellow of Indian Council of Medical Research- African Union/STRC, added. FG keeps mum Our correspondent made repeated efforts to find out what the Federal Ministry of Environment is doing to combat illegal wildlife trade, strengthen existing laws to deter potential offenders, promote wildlife conservation and make Nigeria’s fauna more attractive to local and international tourists. But the efforts were unsuccessful. In a response to an enquiry by our correspondent, an official in the ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “I am having a challenge with the department (in charge); you know this civil service thing, they cannot release information. There is a desk officer in charge of wildlife and they have all the information. They are making it so difficult.”",

Plan your visit to Highland Wildlife Park today Meet the stars of Highland Wildlife Park Have you ever wanted to see wild animals thriving in a natural landscape, all from the comfort and convenience of your very own car? Buckle up for a car-safari and head to the expansive grounds of Highland Wildlife Park. Highland Wildlife Park is home to Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) and hosts a wide variety of animals, from tigers and reindeer to the mighty polar bear. Set within the Cairngorm National Park and overlooking the magnificent Cairngorm Mountains, Highland Wildlife Park is a gateway to the natural world. Here, people can experience untouched nature and learn about the challenges facing wildlife today. Visitors will discover how this incredible park, with the support of RZSS, works to save animals from extinction. At Highland Wildlife Park, there are a number of ways to see the animals. Enjoy the drive-through reserve from the comfort of your own vehicle on a car safari. Here you can spot European bison, Bukhara and red deer, European elk, Przewalski’s horse and vicuna, birdlife and more. At your convenience, you can take in the unspoilt beauty of these magnificent creatures. If you fancy it, stretch your legs and enjoy a walk around the entrance reserve where Bactrian camels roam. Next, embark on a scenic woodland walk. Pay attention – you may be able to spot Scotland’s wildcat, a red squirrel, or even a Eurasian eagle owl. When visiting Highland Wildlife Park, don’t miss Wolf Wood. Opened in 2010 by HRH Princess Anne, the reserve is home to stunning creatures like the Mishmi takin, the Turkmenian markhor, European forest reindeer and of course, the European wolf pack. Wolf Wood is located between the entrance reserve and drive-through reserve and is a top priority on every visitor’s itinerary. This wildlife conservation charity has a bold vision; to create a world where nature is protected, valued and loved! Polar bear A family outing to see Highland Wildlife Park animals isn’t complete without a visit to one of the world’s most incredible beings – the polar bear. Highland Wildlife Park is home to 4 polar bears: Walker, Arktos, Victoria and her cub, Brodie, who is currently the youngest polar bear in Scotland. Often seen swimming, chasing, wrestling and eating together, Walker, Artkos, Victoria and Brodie are amazing ambassadors for their species as they encourage visitors to learn more and protect the polar bear. European grey wolf and Wolf Wood As you wander through Wolf Wood, you may come face to face with one of the European grey wolves at Highland Wildlife Park. Wolves used to be plentiful throughout Scotland but unfortunately have faced decades of persecution, trapping and hunting for their fur. Now, RZSS is working to protect and foster this majestic species. Learn more about Highland Wildlife Park’s wolf conservation project before your next visit. Arctic fox The Arctic fox is a must-see animal at Highland Wildlife Park. Located near the visitor centre are two Arctic foxes: Sarah, a female born in 2019 and Jack, a male who came to Highland Wildlife Park from the Rostock Zoo in October 2022. With striking fur coats (pristinely white in the winter and changing to a darker hue in the summertime), these creatures have fought for survival against the fur trade. At Highland Wildlife Park, you can see beautiful animals thrive. Snow leopard Highland Wildlife Park is home to 5 snow leopards. Animesh, the park’s adult female, was born in 2013 and came from Marwell Zoo in England. Koshi, the male and her mate, arrived in 2020 from The Big Cat Sanctuary. In May 2022, Animesh and Koshi became parents to a trio of cubs, 2 girls and 1 boy, called Maya, Padme and Yashin. You can visit the snow leopards behind the wolverine enclosure on the way up to the viewing area at the top of the hill in the walk-around section. Japanese macaque Also known as the snow monkey, the Japanese macaques at Highland Wildlife Park are part of the European Endangered Species Programme. In recent years, the park has had great success breeding the macaques. Between April and July 2020, the troop welcomed 5 new arrivals. In 2022, little Nakatomi was born. Japanese macaques live in large social groups known as troops, and you can visit the park’s very own macaque troop in the walk around area near the tigers.

          "title": "Birds, bees and sharks: Spring marks the return of wildlife across the north and north-east of Scotland",
          "text": "“Go outside, to the country, enjoy the sun and all nature has to offer,” wrote Anne Frank – a young, Jewish teenager forced to go into hiding with her family during the Holocaust. Over 80 years on and those beautiful words, penned by Anne in her world famous wartime diary, still powerfully resonate. In our ever changing and chaotic world, one source of serenity, hope and positivity remains: spring, when wildlife reawakens and the flowers bloom. From birds and bumblebees to basking sharks and butterflies, Your Life has spoken to three wildlife champions to find out why we should all be getting outside and celebrating this incredible new season and what we should be looking out for. Bea Ayling, conservation officer with the RSPB Listening to screams coming from the skies above may spark fear in most people but for Bea Ayling it’s the glorious sound of spring. Eating, sleeping, bathing and even mating in flight, swifts are aerial acrobats that deeply fascinate Bea, a conservation officer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). Based in Inverness, Bea says there’s something truly magical about the change of season from winter to spring when birds like swifts migrate back to Scotland from Africa. “I love all birds but I especially love the swifts,” says Bea. “They arrive back in early May and they’re just amazing birds. “They never actually land on the ground at all, they sleep in flight, they mate in flight, they’re amazing and their little faces are so cute. “They’re also known as the screamers as they make this screaming sound which is very distinctive.” From London to Inverness Bea’s life as a conservation officer with the RSPB – covering everywhere from the Black Isle and Caithness to Skye, Sutherland and Wester Ross – is a world away from her childhood growing up in the centre of London. “I’ve always loved wildlife,” says Bea. “I grew up in central London so when I was young I loved getting out to the parks and getting out of London to the countryside. “When you live in London you really appreciate the countryside more. “It really inspired me to get involved with wildlife conservation.” Dream job This deep affinity for wildlife turned out to be life changing for Bea who studied zoology and conservation at university before working in various roles for the RSPB before landing her dream job in Inverness. “As part of my role I manage a project that looks after about 40 artificial rafts (nests) for black throated divers which are wetland birds that breed on our Highland Lochs,” says Bea. “I also co-ordinate the monitoring of the tern species across the Moray Firth as well as a species protection project in Brora for breeding arctic tern.” For Bea, spring is one of the most exciting times of the year when the birds migrate back to Scotland after spending their winter in warmer climes. “It’s an exciting season for wildlife,” says Bea. “Everything is heating up towards the breeding season for birds so in March and April all the birds are either returning back to our shores to breed. “You’ll see common birds like blackbirds or house sparows carrying material to build their nests which are usually in hedges. “You’ll also start to hear birds like skylarks singing in order to attract mates. “This is when everything starts to kick off for the summer.” Cuckoos Swallows, small birds with dark, glossy-blue backs, red throats, pale underparts and long tail streamers will also start to reappear as will sand martins which have distinctive dark brown upper parts and dark under wings. “When people are out and about walking their dogs in woodland or moorlands they’ll also start to see wheatear and willow warblers as they come back from their Sub-Saharan wintering ground in Africa.” In the uplands and moorlands, people should also listen out for cuckoos. “In April and May that’s when cuckoos will start calling,” says Bea. “That’s a very recognisable sound.” RSPB nature reserves Although there’s plenty of birds to admire from our own doorsteps, those who wish to explore further afield are sure to enjoy a trip to one of RSPB natures reserves. “We’ve got the Loch Garten Nature Centre which is in the Cairngorms where there are cameras where you can watch the Osprey,” says Bea. “It’s a beautiful location. “We’ve also got reserves in Udale Bay, Nigg and Culbin Sand which are coastal mud flat sites where you can see the waders, geese and ducks.” Nature on the doorstep But people don’t need to travel to a nature reserve to enjoy wildlife though as Bea says there’s plenty of ways to attract it on your doorstep. “Birdboxes are a good start and bird feeders,” says Bea. “Little ponds are also great as the birds can wash and they’re also really good for frogs, newts and other nature. Bea believes lockdown has played a huge part in opening people’s eyes and minds up to the wonder of nature. “I think when we were only allowed one outdoor trip a day people started to really appreciated having nature on their doorstep,” says Bea. “People are really getting out into nature and experiencing it which is good. “If you want to conserve nature you need to get people to appreciate it.” Dr Mark Young, member of The Scottish Wildlife Trust Like the David Attenburgh of Aberdeenshire, listening to Dr Mark Young eloquently talk about the beauty of wildlife is cathartic. As a retired biologist, former Aberdeen University lecturer and one of the UK’s foremost microlepidopterists, – a branch of entomology concerning the scientific study of moths and butterflies – wildlife to Dr Young is the essence of everything. “I believe that it’s extraordinarily important that nature thrives and that everybody has a chance to enjoy it,” says Dr Young, who lives near Oldmeldrum. “I can’t understand why other people don’t find it utterly fascinating. “We need to do better by nature and we need to recognise how amazingly fascinating it is.” Creepy crawlies From creepy crawlies and birds to flowers and trees, everything about nature sparks a sense of awe in Dr Young who is a long serving member of the Aberdeenshire branch of the Scottish Wildlife Trust. Chatting to Your Life while watching the birds in his garden, Dr Young says it brings him a great sense of calm. “Wildlife almost forces mindfulness on you,” says Dr Young. “I’m looking at a bird on one of my bird feeders and I’m not worried about myself, I’m watching this little bird doing its own thing. “We share our world with them and it’s so lovely to watch them and see all the curious things that they do. “Wildlife gives you all of these other things to think about rather than just concerning yourself with yourself.” Glorious bird song One of the first signs that spring has arrived is the distinctive sound of the oyster catchers. “The very first thing I notice is their peeping call in the morning as I’m waking up,” says Dr Young. “I’ve also heard the thrushes singing beautifully so there are signs that nature is waking up to Spring as far as the birds are concerned.” Creepy crawlies are also making a come-back, much to Dr Young’s excitement. “Almost all creepy crawlies tend to come out at this time of year,” says Dr Young. “Spiders are beginning to be much more active. “Sometimes we get annoyed with spiders in our house but they don’t do any harm to us, they feed on flies. “I’ve also seen one or two beetles scurrying about too – everything is beginning to come out.” Butterflies and moths As an esteemed entomology expert, Dr Young is also delighted by the sight of butterflies reemerging. “Small tortoise shell and peacock butterflies are the two species that people might see before long,” says Dr Young. Moths are also back on the scene this spring. “In our part of Scotland we have around 25 species of butterfly and around 500/600 species of larger moths, the sort of things that come into your bathroom and annoy you but they’re not damaging to us,” says Dr Young. “There are about 600-700 species of smaller moths in north-east Scotland but the vast majority are never seen by us because they’re small and crypic. “My real passion is for small moths because they’re less well studied and fewer people know about them.” Local nature reserves Frogs are also leaping back into the spotlight. “In late March into April we’ll begin to see the first frogs and frog spawn around ponds,” says Dr Young. “So if you stand and listen at night you can often hear the frogs croaking.” Although a firm believer that wildlife can be enjoyed everywhere, Dr Young says there are some local Scottish Wildlife Trust nature reserves people can visit. “In the Aberdeen area there are three main reserves,” says Dr Young. “Longhaven Cliffs, up near Peterhead, is a reserve of the Scottish Wildlife Trust with a lovely footpath that runs the length of the cliff so not only do you get very nice views of the sea but you can also see some of the old quarries. “As the spring begins the sea birds start to come in, so you’ll begin to see the guillemots, the razerbills and the kittiwakes and perhaps a wee bit later on but if you’re lucky you’ll see some puffins.” Gight Wood To see the wildflowers blooming, Dr Young says a trip to Gight Wood, on the slopes of the River Ythan between Methlick and Fyvie, is a must. “The blackthorn has the most wonderful white flowers and later on it develops the sloe berries which come out late into the Autumn,” says Dr Young. But you don’t have to travel far to enjoy the wonder of nature. “I want to emphasis that most people see most of their wildlife in what surrounds them every day.” Shane Wasik from Basking Shark Scotland Spotting the triangular shaped fin slowly breaking the surface of the water evokes not terror but sheer elation in Shane Wasik. Ever since watching the infamous 1975 film Jaws – where a killer shark unleashes chaos on a beach community off Cape Cod – Shane has been fascinated by the often unfairly persecuted animals. In fact Shane was so fascinated by sharks that he went on to set up Basking Shark Scotland, an Oban based company offering eco-conscious wildlife adventure tours where people can swim with sharks in the Hebrides and beyond. “It’s exciting when you see the basking sharks,” says Shane, a former diver who fed the sharks at Deep Sea World in North Queensferry. “You see lots of different reactions though as some people are scared as the sharks can be as big as the boat, up to 10 to 12 metres – they’re huge animals. “And the triangular dorsal fin can be over a metre high and provokes certain feelings in people but on the whole people are super excited to see them.” Sharks return to Scottish waters Spring is an exciting time for basking sharks in Scotland as they return to our waters from the sub tropics. Keen to dispell the myths around sharks and their penchant for attacking humans, Shane points out that basking sharks instead eat microscopic animals called zooplankton. “Plankton blooms in spring and that’s generally when the basking sharks turn up,” says Shane. “Generally the main place to see them is on the west coast and there’s a marine protected area for them between Mull and the Isle of Skye. “You can also see them around Orkney, Shetland and the Moray Firth. “Sometimes in the late summer/early autumn we’ll get some late sightings around the north-east coast.” Tricky to spot Unlike dolphins and whales, basking sharks only tend to surface when feeding so they can be difficult to spot. During the spring/ summer, Shane moves his operations to the Isle of Coll where he takes people out and into the water to see the majestic animals. “Most people are blown away, it’s life changing to see them,” says Shane. They are related to the white shark so when you see a silhouette going past with its mouth closed it looks like an absolutely massive predatory shark.” Video Shane hopes that through education and awareness, sharks will be seen in a more positive light. “Every year in the spring, basking sharks turn up and the headline will be sharks stalks coastline and it portrays them in this negative light which is always a tricky thing to try and change,” says Shane. “But I think in Scotland we’ve got a slightly different attitude because basking sharks are more well known and people understand that they are filter feeders.”",

          "title": "Wild about our Isles: TV series brings tourist boost",
          "text": "SCOTS organisation VisitScotland is hailing Sir David Attenborough’s latest hit series Wild Isles. The organisation is now highlighting how the tourism industry can capitalise on visitor interest in wildlife. Following the airing of the first four episodes, online searches for the Cairngorms, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides have seen a large rise. In addition to this, visits to VisitScotland.com pages featuring wildlife have seen an 80 per cent increase following the airing of Wild Isles episodes. Wildlife now has a fresh opportunity to offer experiences that allow visitors to enjoy our fauna responsibly without disrupting these special species in their natural habitat. In the past, Scotland has consistently been ranked top in the UK for water wildlife experiences. YouGov commissioned the national tourism organisation to research rivers as part of the Year of Coasts and Waters 20/21. The research found that two thirds of UK adults thought Scotland is the best part of the UK for exploring rivers (60 per cent), opportunities to see dolphins and whales (34 per cent) and watching coastal wildlife (32 per cent). Previous VisitScotland research has shown that day trips that include watching wildlife/ bird watching generated a collective spend of £54 million. Tour company Wild Discovery, Aberdeenshire, also took part in the filming of Wild Isles. Co-owner Rachael Iveson-Brown explained how the pandemic has resulted in an increase in visitors seeking nature holidays. She added that using reputable businesses to safely enjoy Scotland’s wildlife mean it remains protected. She said: “There has undoubtedly been a rise in the number of people enjoying the outdoors and realising that nature is not only a great mental healer but also fascinating and highly enjoyable. “With the climate and biodiversity crisis at the forefront of a lot of people’s minds visitors want to experience wildlife but also do something about conserving it. “Our ethos is ‘Travel with purpose’ and it’s great that people can come and do just that with us. “It’s extremely important that we protect our wildlife both directly, so we can actually watch and enjoy wildlife. “Also intrinsically, a healthy ecosystem equals better pollination for our crops, improved soils, peatlands for sequestering carbon, substantial woodlands for absorbing water and reducing flooding. “Functional ecosystems and all their wildlife are essential for us in every way.” Rachel continued: “Hopefully people watching Wild Isles will now realise that they can witness world-class wildlife here in our own country and we can’t take it for granted. “One of the most uplifting experiences for us is showing people the likes of white-tailed eagles and orcas, red squirrels and displaying black grouse; from their TV screens to right there in front of them – Scottish wildlife is truly awesome.” Wild Discovery are committed to engaging with responsible tourism even further by planting a native tree per person for each booked experience. They will also provide advice on how guests can travel sustainably, and welcoming a full spectrum of interests and abilities so everyone can enjoy their nature-based experience. Perthshire-based Beyond Adventure, which features ‘beaver safaris’, has also seen a boost in visitor desire to watch wildlife. Managing Director Ross Dempster said: “Scottish wildlife has always played an integral part of every activity we deliver. In recent years we have noticed an increase in people wanting to join our activities, not necessarily to enjoy the canoeing or kayaking but to use them as?vehicles that let them reach areas to enjoy the wildlife. “Our wildlife visitors share our passion for the environment and the wildlife that lives in it. “This passion is always bound to a commitment to protect both the wildlife and the environment that we are lucky?enough to work in every day. “Responsible tourism is at the core of our business ethos. All of our team are dedicated to?constantly reforming our procedures to make sure that we have best practice when looking at access, minimising our carbon footprint and leaving no trace to any of the beautiful areas we visit.” Beyond Adventure is dedicated to protecting the area’s animal life and natural environment by organising litter picks and planting native woodland. Ken Massie, VisitScotland Head of Industry Development, said: “Our natural environment is one of the many things that make Scotland so special and we’re lucky that there are so many experiences across the country that let you enjoy the wonders of our wildlife in a responsible way. “Filmed across the British Isles, Wild Isles showcases Scotland’s unique and beautiful landmarks, coastal scenery and wildlife to audiences and potential visitors from around the UK.“For many communities, screen tourism – where viewers are inspired to visit locations after seeing them on screen – has brought opportunities to grow the local visitor economy and encourage a wider spread of visitors throughout the year.”",

          "title": "Lickable toads and magic mushrooms: wildlife traded on the dark web is the kind that gets you high",
          "text": "The internet has made it easier for people to buy and sell a huge variety of wildlife – from orchids, cacti and fungi to thousands of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and fish, as well as insects, corals and other invertebrates. But alongside legal trade in wildlife, there’s a dark twin – illegal trading of wildlife. Endangered birds with very few left in the wild. Horns sawn off shot rhinos. The illegal wildlife trade is a blight. It puts yet more pressure on nature, adds to biodiversity loss and threatens biosecurity, sustainable development and human wellbeing globally. In our new research, we probed the dark web – the secretive section of the internet deliberately set up out of view of search engines. Most people associate the dark web with illicit drug marketplaces. We wanted to see what types of wildlife were being sold there. The result? Across 51 dark web marketplaces, we found 153 species being sold. These were almost entirely plants and fungi with psychoactive effects, indicating they are part of the well-known dark web drug trade. There were only a small number of advertisements offering vertebrates such as the infamous Colorado River toad, which faces poaching pressure because its skin secretes psychoactive toxins as a defence. Why aren’t traders in illegal wildlife using the dark web? Mainly because the trade in illegally traded animals and animal parts is not hidden – it’s all over the open internet. For instance, the frog toxin kambo used in the ritual that killed a Mullumbimby woman in 2019 is still sold openly. What was being sold on the dark web? We found over 3,000 advertisements selling wildlife species on dark web marketplaces between 2014 and 2020. We searched these marketplaces for keywords relating to wildlife trade and species names. What was for sale? Of the 153 species we found, we verified 68 as containing psychoactive chemicals. The most commonly traded species was a South American tree Mimosa tenuiflora, commonly known as jurema preta, whose bark contains an extremely potent hallucinogen, DMT. Plants made up most of the species being sold, with many coming from Central and Southern America. We also found 19 species of Psilocybe fungi being sold.

Many of the animals we found on the dark web have a long history of being illegally traded, such as live African grey parrots, as well as elephant ivory, rhino horn, and the teeth and skins of tigers and lions. We also found small amounts of less commonly documented wildlife, including the Goliath beetle, Chinese golden scorpion and Japanese sea cucumber. The illegal wildlife trade is hard to stop Globally, the wildlife trade is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). But the regulated market is just a fraction of the whole. To date, CITES protects less than 5% of traded species. The number of species traded live outnumbers the regulated trade by at least three times, according to some estimates. To date, there have been few effective disincentives to stop traffickers from selling illegal wildlife online. Punishments for convicted wildlife traffickers are not effective, with Australian traffickers continuing to harvest animals even after being caught. Efforts to combat wildlife trafficking online are increasing. One positive recent initiative is the End Wildlife Trafficking Online coalition. It’s a collaboration between animal NGOs and online platforms like Facebook, Alibaba and eBay aimed at rooting out online trafficking. While clamping down on illicit open web trade is crucial, crackdowns here make it more likely that a wider range of wildlife will surface on the dark web. What can be done? Australia and all other nations that have signed up to CITES have a responsibility to keep track of internet-based wildlife trade. At recent CITES conferences resolutions were made to track and report all internet trade – including on the dark web – in an effort to boost monitoring and enforcement of wildlife trafficked online. One stumbling block is the legality of online trade, which depends on factors such as the laws of the country or countries involved and whether the sale actually took place. To stop the trafficking of iconic Australian species such as shingleback lizards and red-tailed black cockatoos, authorities here have to monitor what native species are being bought and sold online, as well as the species trafficked into and through Australia. Since 2019 we have been monitoring the wildlife trade in Australia, drawing data from over 80 websites and forums. Datasets like this will be vital in monitoring and combating internet-facilitated wildlife crime as it continues to grow – especially if enforcement drives traffickers to harder-to-access parts of the internet like the dark web.

          "title": "What does the Wildlife Management and Muirburn Bill mean for Scotland?",
          "text": "Holyrood’s Rural Affairs & Islands Committee has been calling for views on the Scottish Government's new Wildlife Management and Muirburn (Scotland) Bill. What is the Bill? Introduced in March, the Bill contains measures to address wildlife crime, tackle raptor persecution and ensure grouse moors that are not being managed in a sustainable and welfare-focused way are being so. The Bill also looks at muirburn, a controversial practice of controlled burning of vegetation which critics say can pose a risk to wildlife, while those in favour insist it helps promote biodiversity and acts as a protector against wildfires. Why has the Bill been introduced? The Scottish Government said a report from NatureScot in May 2017 found that around a third of satellite-tagged golden eagles in Scotland disappeared \"in suspicious circumstances”, on or around grouse moors. In response, Roseanna Cunningham, the then Cabinet Secretary for the Environment, commissioned an independent group to look at the environmental impact of grouse moor management – the Grouse Moor Management Group (GMMG). The GMMG report (otherwise known as the Werritty Review) made more than 40 recommendations, including on licensing grouse shooting, muirburn and the use of traps. The Bill’s aim, therefore, is to address raptor persecution and to ensure the management of all grouse moors is done in an “environmentally sustainable and welfare conscious manner.” Here are the headline proposals of the Bill: - A new licensing scheme for the killing or taking of certain birds (initially red grouse only), otherwise known as “grouse moor management license” - A licensing scheme for the use of certain wildlife traps - A ban on the use of glue traps - trays coated with an extremely sticky adhesive commonly used for pest control - Enabling powers that certain persons may be appointed to exercise in relation to wildlife crime investigations, which potentially includes SSPCA officers - A year-round licensing scheme for muirburn A closer look: Licencing scheme for killing or taking birds (initially red grouse) – “the grouse moor management licence” The proposals state that the purpose of this licensing scheme is to “address the ongoing issue of wildlife crime, and in particular the persecution of raptors on managed grouse moors.” The Bill said this will be enabled by enabling the licence to be modified, suspended or revoked, “where there is robust evidence of raptor persecution or another relevant wildlife crime related to grouse moor management.” Some key features of the proposed licence are: - The licensing authority will be NatureScot and licences will only be granted if NatureScot is satisfied that it is “appropriate” to do so. The Bill does not define what “appropriate” means - Licenses may only be granted or renewed for a maximum period of one year - It will be an offence if the shooting of red grouse happens on land where the landowner has not sought a licence for doing so - Licenses can be modified by NatureScot at any time. The government agency can also revoke or suspend a licence for reasons including: - NatureScot’s decisions on the licence scheme can be appealed in the Sheriff Court Such an offence could result in imprisonment for up to 12 months or a fine up to £40,000; or on conviction of indictment, imprisonment for up to five years or an unlimited fine, or both. What do the critics say about this? Critics of the Bill say the proposed licence scheme as is stands is flawed “because it goes well beyond the central issue of raptor persecution”, which they say is now at a “historic low.” Moorland management groups say the proposals allows triggers for licence revocation and suspension that has “nothing to do with raptor persecution.” Ross Ewing, director of moorland at Scottish Land & Estates (SLE), said: “If you’ve committed a crime under the protection of the Badgers Act, let’s say, you could have your licence to shoot grouse taken away or suspended which is completely unacceptable. “We would accept it if it was related to raptor persecution on it’s own, but the fact that it goes beyond that is unacceptable.” He said members of the rural estates organisation said the notion that an investigation on its own is enough grounds to suspend a licence is “particularly concerning.” \"Police investigations could easily be started if I decided to ring up and say I saw X shooting said bird on Y estate. Under the terms of the Bill, Naturescot would have every right to suspend your licence just for that baseless vexatious allegation.” A licensing scheme for the use of certain wildlife traps The purpose of the wildlife trap licensing scheme is to ensure that wildlife trapping is being undertaken in an environmentally sustainable manner. The Bill said it recognises certain traps are an important wildlife management and pest control technique. The proposals make limited modification to the existing legislation on the use of live capture bird traps or traps approved by the Spring Traps Approval (Scotland) Order 2011, but adds the requirement that individuals using those traps must hold a licence and meet the following conditions: - Complete training by an approved body each time they apply or renew their licence - Register with the relevant authority (Scottish Ministers or if delegated NatureScot) for a unique licence number - Display this unique licence number on each trap they use - Use the trap in accordance with the training A person convicted of these offences will be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment up to 12 months or a £40,000 fine (or both); and on indictment to imprisonment for up to five years or an unlimited fine; or both. A ban on the use of glue traps Glue traps (sometimes known as sticky boards or glue boards) are devices used for a variety of purposes, primarily to control ground rodents. Conservation groups have said they are more commonly used for pest control rather than wildlife management. The Bill will make it a criminal offence to: - Set a glue trap for the purpose of catching any animal (other than an invertebrate) - Use a glue trap in a manner that is likely to cause bodily injury to any animal (other than an invertebrate) - Purchase a glue trap that is designed to capture any animal (other than an invertebrate) unless this is purchased for use outwith Scotland and is delivered outwith Scotland. A person convicted of these offences will be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment up to 12 months or a £40,000 fine (or both); and on indictment to imprisonment for up to five years or an unlimited fine; or both. It said banning the use of glue traps would have an immediate positive impact on the welfare of rodents and other species they are used to trap. The Scottish Government said it has not found any UK manufacturers of glue traps so it understands impact on this specific industry will be limited. Enabling powers that certain persons may be appointed to exercise in relation to wildlife crime investigations, including the SSPCA The Bill contains proposals to allow Scottish Ministers to extend the powers of inspectors to investigate relevant offences relating to wild animals, which could potentially include SSPCA officers, should they deem it appropriate to do so. What do the critics say? Some conservation groups have voiced concern over the notion of affording charities statutory powers to investigate crimes as setting a “dangerous precedent.” SLE said some of the campaigning the charity does around certain land management tools could present a conflict of interest when it comes to investigating wildlife crime. Mr Ewing said: “SSPCA officers don’t tend to be trained to the same standard as police officers when it comes to investigating crime; they don’t have to go through the same vetting process as officers Police Scotland.” A year-round licensing scheme for muirburn The Werritty review report recognised the benefits of muirburn: that it provides nutritious shoots for grouse, livestock, deer and mountain hares, can increase biodiversity in dry heaths. However, it also said there was strong evidence muirburn can have a “detrimental effect on biodiversity, hydrology, and soil stability.” The report concluded that muirburn should be subject to greater regulation and oversight. The new Bill proposes the requirement of a licence all year round for muirburn on any land in Scotland. The purpose of the licensing scheme is to “ensure that muirburn is being undertaken in an environmentally sustainable manner, with due consideration of all the possible consequences.” The policy memorandum states there is currently no scientific consensus on the effects of muirburn therefore the Bill contains powers to modify the regulations of muirburn in the future, as further scientific evidence is developed. Some key features of the muirburn licensing scheme are as follows: - Any landowner or occupier wishing to make muirburn will require a licence to do so. The licensing authority is NatureScot. - There are two types of license applications: (a) licenses related to “peatland” (defined as land with peat deeper than 40cm); and (b) licenses related to non-peatland (which apply to land where the peat is shallower than 40cm) - Licenses will be valid for such period as prescribed by NatureScot - Licenses may be suspended or revoked if a) NatureScot are satisfied that a relevant person has committed a relevant offence; or b) there is an official investigation or proceedings in relation to an offence It would become an offence to carry out muirburn without a licence being in place. Such an offence could result in imprisonment for up to six months or a fine of up to £5,000; or both. What do the critics say? Some conservations say the muirburn proposals “lack scientific rigorousness in terms of understanding how it plays a role in ecosystems and making land more resilient to wildlife.” Mr Ewing added: “People get this notion that peatland is being burnt, but it’s not peatland, it’s the upper layer of vegetation. “The Scottish Government is going about regulating the practice in an arbitrary way using a below ground metric (40cm) to regulate an above ground activity which I think is illogical.” Other conservationists have insist muirburn provides favourable habitat for ground nesting birds such as the curlew, while Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has backed it as an important practice to prevent wildfires. Next steps: The Bill is currently at Stage 1 and the Rural Affairs and Islands Committee will be closing a consultation where it called for views from interested parties on May 5. Key stakeholders have already raised several questions of detail that will need to be addressed. What does this mean for rural Scotland if it’s passed? While the Bill promotes positive steps for Scotland’s countryside, including the potential to reduce wildlife crime and increase more sustainable practices when it comes to managing land, rural groups have expressed concern about the social, economic and environmental impact it could bring as it stands. SLE, which has many members working in moorland management, said the new licencing proposals could see people ceasing to invest in Scotland’s moorlands. Mr Ewing said this could have a “catastrophic” impact on employment for the communities who work on and live off rural estates. He said the disincentivisation of moorland management could also have an impact on threatened species including curlew and lapwing which he said thrive in moorland areas. On muirburn, Mr Ewing said if the practice was heavily restricted, Scotland’s wildfire risk is going to be “prolific.” \"Tourist organisations in Scotland revere our purple heather moorlands associated with grouse moors,” Mr Ewing said. \"The proposals as they stand will have a significant downstream consequences for our rural communities in Scotland so we must get this legislation right.”",

          "title": "Climate change is destroying habitats. But relocating species could be tricky",
          "text": "Alex Brown | Stateline.org (TNS) Nine years ago, a team of scientists studying a violet-blue, thumb-sized butterfly found only two remaining in a rolling landscape of dunes along southern Lake Michigan. The last two Karner blue butterflies ever seen in that area emerged two years after an unusually hot spring wiped out most of their ancestors. The warmth caused the caterpillars to hatch from their eggs early, before the lupine plant they eat had emerged from the soil. Just like that, the southernmost population of the endangered butterfly was gone. The Karner blue already has lost 99.98% of its habitat. The refuge in Indiana Dunes National Park once had provided the template for efforts to save the insect, but now wildlife managers are looking north. The remaining populations of the Karner blue face the same fate as their southern cousins. Because of climate change, the butterfly may not be able to survive in its current territory within 30 to 40 years. “Even if there was a solid line of lupine and habitat going north, they wouldn’t be able to keep up,” said Chris Hoving, climate adaptation specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. “They just don’t fly fast enough.” So, Hoving and other wildlife managers nationwide are asking an increasingly urgent question: Should species that might be killed by warming temperatures, sea level rise, droughts and wildfires be moved to places they’ve never lived before? State and federal wildlife officials want to consider moving the Karner blue north, but federal rules stand in the way. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which oversees plants and animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, prohibits the relocation of endangered species outside their historical range. That’s on the verge of changing. In the coming weeks, the federal agency is expected to issue a final rule that would empower wildlife officials to relocate species marooned on shrinking “climate islands.” The proposal, first released a year ago, would allow those species to be moved to areas deemed more suitable for their survival, a tactic known as assisted migration. “We’re looking at climate change and the rapid spread of invasive species that are imposing increasing threats on native biodiversity,” said Elizabeth Maclin, division chief for restoration and recovery with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “This proposed rule would allow us to, where we need to, establish experimental populations outside of historic ranges.” Wildlife managers in Michigan and some other states, along with many environmental organizations and some wildlife scientists, believe the change is desperately needed to give many species a chance to survive a warming planet. But other states, backed by other wildlife scientists, fear the proposal could lead to disaster. ‘A very risky experiment’ In Arizona, state biologists have long worked with the feds to bring back the Mexican gray wolf, a species native to the Southwest with only a few hundred individuals remaining in the wild. Some conservation groups want the wolves introduced farther north than they’re currently found — with ongoing disputes over the wolf’s historic range. “The Mexican wolf is the best example of why this [proposed rule change] is a bad idea,” said Jim Heffelfinger, wildlife science coordinator with the Arizona Game and Fish Department. “There’s a whole host of unforeseen, unintended and irreversible ecological consequences of people moving species around. Taking animals outside of the ecological and evolutionary pressures that shaped them is a very risky experiment.” Heffelfinger and his colleagues fear the rule change could be used to establish Mexican wolves in northern Arizona. They fear the relocated Mexican wolves could interbreed with other wolf species in that area, causing “genetic swamping” that would further imperil the species. And the wolf’s introduction might damage the wildlife that already calls that region home. “It basically becomes an exotic species in that new habitat and may have very harmful impacts on existing species that have not evolved together to adapt,” said Jim Odenkirk, general counsel with the Arizona agency. “The negative impacts may outweigh the conservation benefits.” Some conservation groups dispute the state’s assertions, arguing that habitat to the north is needed to support a growing population of wolves. The fierce divide over where the wolves belong could be a preview of the fights to come. Much like Michigan and Arizona, some state wildlife agencies have taken widely diverging views on the feds’ proposal. Other states have expressed general support for the need to relocate species but raised concerns about specific elements of the proposal — often calling for more state involvement on such decisions. As they await a final decision, wildlife managers, scientists and environmental activists are still grappling with what the change would mean. ‘Neither of those choices are great’ Federal officials already have some power to move species. Under a provision of the Endangered Species Act, federal wildlife managers can introduce experimental populations of plants and animals in areas where they previously lived. The Fish and Wildlife Service has used that provision to establish 73 experimental populations, representing 47 species. The National Marine Fisheries Service has also reintroduced some marine species under that authority. The law also allows for such introductions to happen outside a species’ historic range, but only in rare circumstances in which its original habitat has been “unsuitably and irreversibly altered or destroyed.” The agency is proposing to use that exemption to relocate, for example, the Guam kingfisher to new habitat, helping it escape an invasive snake that threatens the bird’s survival in its historic territory. Some states say that wording gives the agency the authority to help imperiled species. But the new proposal would allow species to be moved before their habitat is completely lost, giving wildlife managers a head start against the oncoming threats of climate change. “If we wait until the species’ habitat is underwater, it’s too late,” said Elise Bennett, Florida director and senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group. “If we don’t open this opportunity up, some species are going to just disappear.” Some conservationists have noted that while species naturally migrate over time, climate change is altering conditions faster than they can move, and development and human-made obstacles may block their migration corridors. “Ranges aren’t set in stone, but we’ve changed so much of the planet that species can’t adopt range shifts like they used to be able to do, so they might need help,” said Andrew Carter, director of conservation policy with Defenders of Wildlife, a conservation advocacy group. Some wildlife researchers say they see the need for the rule change, but they also see how it could go wrong. “You either have to allow for species to go extinct because they’re no longer compatible where they are, or move them to a new area where they may turn into an invasive species or cause other kinds of problems,” said Alejandro Camacho, faculty director for the Center for Land, Environment, and Natural Resources at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. “Neither of those choices are great.” While Camacho and others have expressed cautious support for the proposal, some believe it’s likely to cause more problems than it solves. “They are acting as if they can handle the threat of unintended consequences that we see all the time with invasive species,” said Dan Simberloff, environmental science professor at the University of Tennessee. “To do a serious risk assessment would take about a doctoral dissertation’s worth of research, and they’re not going to spend that kind of money or take that kind of time to do that.” Even if the rule is changed, said Jessica Hellmann, executive director of the University of Minnesota’s Institute on the Environment, the number of species threatened by climate change far outweighs the resources and political will to relocate them. “It’s just a massive amount of effort if we thought about applying it at scale,” she said. “It will undoubtedly be pursued for some species but not others. It’s not a pathway for conservation for all species.” As they await a final announcement, researchers and wildlife officials say regardless of the feds’ decision, the conversation is likely just beginning. “In order to save some species, you have to look outside of where they’ve been — unless you give up on the species, and none of us want to do that,” said Kyle Briggs, chief deputy director of the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. “But you can’t put a species somewhere it’s never been and not expect some level of impact.” ____ TIMELINE 1973: Endangered Species Act passed by Congress. 1982: Amendments to the act allow for the introduction of “experimental populations” of endangered species in areas where they used to be found. 2022: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes a rule change that would allow for experimental populations to be established outside of their historic range, noting that the act’s initial wording did not anticipate the effects of climate change. ©2023 States Newsroom.

          "text": "Alex Brown | Stateline.org (TNS) North Carolina might need to move a snail. A tiny mollusk known as the magnificent ramshorn has long made its home in the state’s freshwater coastal ponds. But sea level rise and storm surges are making those ponds saltier, and the snail can’t tolerate salt. The coastal plain that was once the species’ habitat has no snails left — the only surviving members are bred in captivity. The state hopes to reintroduce the snail in one remaining pond, but little of the habitat where it once lived can now support it. “There are very few places that exist in its known historic range that would still be suitable for it to live,” said Kyle Briggs, chief deputy director of the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. If the magnificent ramshorn is to flourish in the wild again, it may well have to be somewhere new. It’s among many species that are finding their long-established habitats increasingly inhospitable because of warmer temperatures, rising oceans, wildfires and droughts. Some wildlife officials want to help those plants and animals find new homes, a tactic known as assisted migration. In the coming weeks, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to issue a final rule that could allow wildlife managers to introduce endangered species in habitats where they’ve never been seen before. “It just allows us to have more flexibility when that is needed,” said Elizabeth Maclin, division chief for restoration and recovery with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “When a habitat has been depleted to the extent that it’s no longer suitable for a species, we’re able to have the tools we need to prevent its extinction.” States such as North Carolina have been following the proposal closely since the agency released it a year ago. They see the threats climate change poses, and many acknowledge that some species won’t survive without help getting to new places. But state wildlife officials disagree about whether the feds’ plan is a good idea. In Michigan, wildlife managers hope the change will allow them to move a tiny blue butterfly northward. Arizona officials, however, fear that relocating a wolf to a new habitat could unleash serious ecological risks. Other states, including North Carolina, are willing to consider assisted migration but have deep concerns about how it will be carried out. “This is a really big opportunity that I’d hate for us to miss, but I think it needs to be done correctly and with the concurrence of the states,” Briggs said. North Carolina is among several states asking for a “concurrence” provision, essentially requiring state wildlife officials’ approval before the feds could move a species. The federal agency would not comment on whether it is considering those requests. The states’ role The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service oversees management of endangered species including the magnificent ramshorn (for marine species, that role falls to the National Marine Fisheries Service). But state wildlife managers often work closely with the feds on plans to preserve and restore those populations, such as habitat restoration projects and landowner incentive programs. And state agencies are responsible for keeping species without federal protection out of the “emergency room.” They are wary of threats that could place a species under endangered status, removing it from the state’s purview and bringing along a host of federal regulations and restrictions. The Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies, a nonprofit advocacy group representing state wildlife managers, expressed “cautious support” for the federal proposal, said Lane Kisonak, the group’s chief legal officer. While the group’s member agencies have differing views on the rule, he said, they share a belief that any species relocation efforts should require extensive collaboration with the states. “There’s a strong desire by the states to have that cooperation maximized should a final version of this rule be implemented,” he said. In Hawaii, which has more endangered species than any other state, wildlife officials have welcomed the proposal. Two species of Hawaiian honeycreepers are among the forest birds that are particularly threatened as climate change brings invasive mosquitoes — and deadly avian malaria — into upper elevation forests. “We’re the endangered species capital of the world, and our landscape has changed so much,” said Kathryn Stanaway, program specialist with the Division of Forestry and Wildlife in the state Department of Land and Natural Resources. “We want to establish populations outside of their historical range in some instances, and we can do that under state law, but we can’t do that under federal law the way it’s currently written.” But some wildlife managers fear the assisted migration of federally protected species could prove harmful to other species under the states’ care. Wyoming officials have identified more than 800 species of “greatest conservation need,” which are not currently listed as endangered but may require state action to address declining populations. “Our role is to keep those species common,” said Angela Bruce, deputy director of external affairs at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “Putting endangered species in non-historic ranges could throw off the ecological balance and throw off all the great work we’re trying to do. The risk is too high to jeopardize all the other species.” Much of the Wyoming agency’s conservation work comes through voluntary partnerships with landowners, who are wary of the restrictions that often come along with endangered species status. Putting such species in new places would jeopardize those relationships, Bruce said. While Wyoming sees the proposal as a threat to its own wildlife management efforts, others believe it could empower states. Doug Vincent-Lang, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said the rule change could be the first step to one day allowing species to be moved before they’re listed as endangered. Such preemptive rescues also would keep those species from falling under federal authority. “We see [assisted migration] as a means to move species around the landscape to prevent them from getting listed under the Endangered Species Act,” he said. “That would allow us to retain state management.” Vincent-Lang mentioned wolverines as a candidate for relocation. If assisted migration were eventually allowed for state-managed species, Alaska officials could help wolverines migrate to more suitable areas before dwindling snowpack in their current range put them on the endangered species list. The track record Washington state has successfully reintroduced fishers, a small member of the weasel family that had been eradicated in the state because of trapping and habitat loss. While state wildlife officials support changing the rule to allow such relocations in new ranges, they caution that it won’t be an easy answer to habitat loss caused by climate change. “Translocations are difficult, expensive, they don’t always succeed and there’s a lot of risks,” said Hannah Anderson, wildlife diversity division manager with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. “I would perceive [assisted migration] as another tool in the toolbox, but it’s not like we would immediately jump to that.” While the Washington agency supports the rule change, Native tribes that serve as co-managers of the state’s fisheries are skeptical. “This would need to be done very carefully, in full consultation and collaboration with affected tribes, and we don’t see a track record that leads us to believe that that’s the way this would move forward,” said Rob Jones, fisheries policy analyst with the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, a coordinating body for treaty tribes in western Washington. “This is a half-baked idea without those specifics.” At least a dozen states weighed in through comment letters sent to the federal agency. Wildlife officials in Oregon, Florida and Missouri all said species may need to be moved to new areas to save them from climate change, but urged the feds to craft strong safeguards that acknowledge the ecological risks of such maneuvers. Leaders in New Mexico and Montana opposed it altogether. “To introduce experimental populations to new ecosystems renders the experimental population nothing more than an invasive species, threatening the natural balance within the ecosystem unaccustomed to its presence,” wrote Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican. Many states — both supporters and opponents of the rule — also expressed concern about social and economic consequences. Areas with endangered animals and plants can face severe limitations on development, ranching, mining and other land-use activities that could disrupt the species. Federal officials say that past reintroductions of endangered species — in areas where they’d previously lived — show that the model can work. Such “experimental populations” can have more flexible rules that are often less restrictive, but some states still fear that adding endangered species to a landscape could have major economic consequences and public backlash for those regions. Maclin, with the federal agency, said introductions of experimental populations account for the community impact. She pointed to the black-footed ferret, which has been reintroduced with allowances that permit landowners to manage their lands without fear they will inadvertently violate the Endangered Species Act. While states weigh the ecological and economic repercussions of the proposal, many environmental advocates say it would be more costly not to act. “This is an emergency room situation where species are going to blink out if we don’t help them,” said Elise Bennett, Florida director and senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group. “We would much prefer and urge preventative care, but within the policy framework of the Endangered Species Act, Congress was quite clear that we have to prevent extinction of a species — no matter what the cost is.” ©2023 States Newsroom.

          "text": "Imagine coming across an injured kangaroo on the side of the road. Or a bat entangled in fruit tree netting. Would you know who to call to get help? After a quick search, you find the number of your local wildlife rescue service and give them a call. A trained operator gathers the information they need to assess your case and coordinate rescue and rehabilitation if needed. Across Australia, wildlife emergency response hotlines, such as Wildlife Victoria in Victoria, WIRES in New South Wales and smaller groups throughout the country, offer valuable help to wildlife and members of the public who encounter wildlife emergencies. Data from these services can also help us understand how human activities harm wildlife at a local level. And that in turn highlights what can be done to better protect wildlife. In newly published research, our team analysed a ten-year dataset from Wildlife Victoria, the main wildlife emergency response service in that state. The service responded to more than 30,000 cases a year, on average, between 2010 and 2019. Around 400 cases a year involved threatened species. Read more: 10 million animals are hit on our roads each year. Here’s how you can help them (and steer clear of them) these holidays Human activities are the greatest threat Many such services operate on a daily basis. They collect enormous amounts of information on human and non-human threats to wildlife, particularly in urban areas. When you call a service about an animal, a rescuer might need to attend or, if safe to do so, you might be asked to take the animal to a vet clinic free of charge for assessment. Or it might be that the animal, such as a fledgling bird on the ground, just needs to be left alone. Confirming what studies in Australia and elsewhere have shown, our results demonstrate that human activities do the most harm to wildlife, as opposed to more natural causes such as severe weather or being preyed on by other animals. A majority of cases were reported in the Greater Melbourne area rather than the rest of the state. As might be expected, common species accounted for most cases. Eastern grey kangaroos, ringtail and brushtail possums and magpies were the most commonly reported species. Of 443 identified species reported to the service, 81 were listed as threatened. The majority of cases involving threatened species (on the Fauna and Flaura Guarantee Act 1988 Threatened List) concerned grey-headed flying foxes. Generally, the main causes for concern were collisions with vehicles, animals found in an abnormal location (an unnatural habitat where they did not belong) or in buildings, and attacks by cats or dogs. Read more: What happens after you take injured wildlife to the vet? Some species were disproportionately impacted by some threats rather than others and in some locations. For example, kangaroos and koalas were more likely to be victims of vehicle collisions outside Greater Melbourne. In contrast, ringtail possums were more likely to be attacked by cats within the metropolitan area. Flying foxes were more frequently reported within Greater Melbourne. The main cause of concern was entanglements in nets such as fruit tree netting. The data thus confirmed the danger these nets present. Read more: Our laws failed these endangered flying-foxes at every turn. On Saturday, Cairns council will put another nail in the coffin Services struggle to keep up with demand Worryingly, Wildlife Victoria recorded a 2.5-fold increase in reported cases from 2010 to 2019. However, such services are often under-resourced. While the number of cases increased, the number of volunteers able to respond to cases did not. This means a lower proportion of all cases can receive the support they need. Using data from services such as Wildlife Victoria can help us understand service-demand gaps and where resources would be best allocated to fill these gaps. We also showed such services provide invaluable education to the community. Around one in five calls resulted in education, rather than requiring an emergency response. Read more: Testing the stress levels of rescued koalas allows us to tweak their care so more survive in the wild Databases are a largely untapped resource Wildlife emergency response services have a wealth of data that describe the species-specific and location-specific threats wildlife face. Local wildlife managers and organisations interested in protecting wildlife from common threats before they occur could use this data to understand what they can do to achieve this. For example, the data can help pinpoint where measures such as educating the community on responsible pet ownership, banning the sale of dangerous netting or wire and reducing speed limits would be effective depending on the wildlife affected in specific areas. The data could also help monitor the success of new laws, campaigns and measures to protect wildlife. For example, researchers in Queensland have used data from their local wildlife rescue services to quantify the reduction in koala deaths from car strikes and dog attacks following a campaign to raise awareness of threats to koalas. This source of information is invaluable because such data can be hard and costly for ecologists and conversationists to collect. Interested in interacting with Wildlife Victoria’s historical data?

          "text": "Home to an astonishing array of fascinating creatures and habitats, the UK offers a wealth of wildlife spots which attract nature enthusiasts and conservationists alike. And now, BBC Wildlife magazine has revealed the UK’s 10 favourite places for wildlife as nominated by people in the network as part of its 60th anniversary celebrations in January. Conservationists, authors, presenters, and photographers chose the locations to highlight their finest wildlife spots in the UK. The places, which ranged from lofty peaks to beautiful seas, were then put to a public vote on YouGov. The winner is the stunning Causeway Coast, a wild place of outstanding natural beauty with dunes, sheer cliffs and the amazing rock formations of the magnificent Giant’s Causeway. The region also hosts a wonderful wealth of marine wildlife, from seals to basking sharks. In second place is South London’s Wimbledon Common, nominated by author Jini Reddy. Covering 460 hectares of green space, the capital’s famous green lung is both an SSSI and Special Area of Conservation, thanks to its rich grassland and heathland, and provides a home to a diversity of wildlife including badgers, foxes, kestrels and kingfishers. Third place falls to Scotland’s Scaur Glen as nominated by Juliet Vickery from the British Trust Ornithology. The Scaur River passes through this glen, bubbling through moorland, meandering through sheep pasture and tumbling through wooded riverbanks to Penpont. The beautiful Isles of Scilly, off Cornwall follows in fourth, with Yorkshire’s Rodley Nature Reserve in fifth. Tara Shine, an environmental scientist who nominated the Causeway Coast, said: “I’m absolutely delighted that the Causeway Coast has been voted the UK’s favourite place for wildlife. “While studying at Ulster University, I spent some of my most memorable days near, in and under the water here, catching waves off the sandy beach at Portrush, snorkelling with curious grey seals, and scuba-diving off the Skerries and below the dramatic cliffs of Rathlin Island, where I glided over stony reefs with dogfish and among shipwrecks with conger eels. “I hope more people can experience the natural wonders of this little-known gem, and support local efforts to protect and enhance it. You will find peace, an abundance of wildlife and a warm welcome from those people who call it home.” BBC Wildlife Editor Paul McGuiness said: “Since we launched our quest to find the nation’s favourite place for wildlife, it’s been a joy to really delve into the huge variety of wildlife we have in these islands. From the clear waters of the Isles of Scilly to the majesty of the Scottish Highlands, and everything in between, we have so much to celebrate and enjoy right here on our doorstep”. So, whether you are a wildlife enthusiast, a nature lover, or simply someone wishing to get away from it all, the UK has a plethora of wildlife spots just waiting to be discovered. Below are the results of 10 UK’s favourite places for wildlife as revealed by BBC Wildlife. 1. The Causeway Coast, Northern Ireland (Nominated by Tara Shine, environmental scientist and science communicator) “The Causeway Coast is a wild place of outstanding natural beauty, with dunes, cliffs, and, of course, the amazing rock formations of the Giant’s Causeway. I’ve spent some of my most memorable days exploring the sea here - it enthrals every time.” 2. Wimbledon Common, South-west London (Nominated by Jini Reddy, author and journalist) “Wimbledon Common is a favourite wild place in all seasons and provides a marvellous green lung for Londoners. I particularly love Queensmere Pond. Shrouded by woods, at noon and a blue-sky day, it’s a tranquil sun-trap with the feel of a far more remote wilderness.” 3. Scaur Glen, Dumfriesshire, Scotland (Nominated by Juliet Vickery, British Trust Ornithology) “The Scaur rises in Polskeoch on the Southern Upland Way, bubbles through moorland, meanders through pasture and tumbles through woodland to Penpot. I spent three summers here for my PhD; 35 years later, summer still draws me back.” 4. The Isles of Scilly, Cornwall (Nominated by Lucy McRobert, author and communications manager at IOS Wildlife Trust) “From windswept winters to sun kissed summer days, life on the Atlantic edge is ever-changing. I’ve been at sea surrounded by shearwaters, skuas and storm petrels, I’ve watched humpbacks on Christmas Eve, and twice a year, I’m treated to an array of migrant birds, from hoopoes to bee-eaters.” 5. Rodley Nature Reserve, Leeds, Yorkshire (Nominated by Pam Taylor, British Dragonfly Society) “Nestled between Horsforth and the River Aire, Rodley is a dragonfly and damselfly hotspot on the edge of the city. At least 18 species have been recorded here.” 6. RSPB Ynys-Hir, Ceredigion, Wales (Nominated by Martin Hughes-Games, BBC presenter) “Of all the places I visited in my 10 years co-presenting Springwatch, this is the most memorable. The scenery is spectacular, and every day I was plunged into a world teeming with wildlife, including, to name a few stars, otters, hen harriers and grass snakes.” 7. Winter Hill, Greater Machester (Nominated by Anitha Sethi, nature writer) “When I climb to the summit of Winter Hill, I feel like I’m on top of the world. The site, managed by The Woodland Trust, is being restored and revitalised with tree-planting galore. Wildlife to look out for includes cuckoos, deer and common lizards.” 8. RSPB Middleton Lakes, Staffordshire (Nominated by Lucy Lapwing, naturalist) “Hidden between the urban stretches of Tamworth and Birmingham, this patch of rustling reedbeds and stretching skies has become a place of learning and escape. The hours spent absorbing wild things here are consistently uplifting. 9. St Catherine’s Hill Nature Reserve, Hampshire (Nominated by Chris Packham, BBC presenter) “I bounded up these slopes in 1966, looking for rabbits and stoats. In 1986, I chased kestrels for a BBC film, in 1996 I climbed to the top to combat a bout of depression. I trudged to the summit again in 2016 with my poodle, Scratchy, just before he died, and again last year to honour my late father. St Catherine’s Hill has made and saved my life. 10. Canvey Wick Nature Reserve, Essex (Nominated by Karim Vahed, Buglife) “Sitting in the corner of Canvey Island, Canvey Wick is home to a phenomenal variety of invertebrates. It’s one of the best places in Britain for endangered insects, home to rarities such as the shrill carder bee and scarce emerald damselfly.”",
